Thanks to AI, bad science and conspiracy theories are on the rise. Recently, a Facebook page called ""Sharring"" posted the image you see here.
In the post, they wrote, ""Archaeologists stunned: The discovery of an alien-like skeleton in the desert rewrites history."" It received over 700 shares, 11,000 likes, and thousands of comments.
Sadly, many comments and shares indicate that people believe the post to be real.
But the spread of fake news isn't entirely due to AI. Similar instances have occurred in the past, such as the Atacama skeleton discovered in Chile in 2003. Initially speculated to be of extraterrestrial origin due to its unusual features, subsequent DNA analysis confirmed it to be a human fetus with genetic mutations.
But the alien theories related to the fetus continue to spread on social media today.
Yet, the proliferation of artificial intelligence has made it easier to create and disseminate convincing (and entirely false information). This underscores the necessity for vigilance and skepticism when encountering *any* claims online — yes, even things I say.
Verifying information through reputable sources and consulting scientific literature can help prevent the spread of misinformation.
In this case, the ""alien-like skeleton"" is a fabrication, and the widespread sharing of such posts highlights the need for improved digital literacy and critical thinking among social media users.
