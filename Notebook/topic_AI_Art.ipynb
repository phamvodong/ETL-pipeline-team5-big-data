      "  ai art doesn't bother me but like I don't think prompters or whatever should be able to enter contests and competitions to win. I know it sounds dumb but the AI made the art so instead of the prompter, The AI uses references and essentially studied how to use certain techniques to render certain things (albeit in a frankenstein way rather than naking their own consistent style). It was only a matter of time until this happened and AI is just going to get better at it. Worst of all we will reach the point where AI becomes sentient enough to create art out of free will does that mean AI will not be able to make art because they lack the humanity to make art?\n",

Most art is made because it means something, or intends to mimic it with the style of the creator, which is why self-portraits aren’t too creative, but have effort and interpretation within it. Photography is art imo because it intends to capture something, and there is often meaning behind the photo, why else would someone take a picture? AI art however is randomly generated from thousands of photos to generate something, so while it’s art, it s not *art*.\n",

I know this because I've trained models myself to create new fan works of video game characters that are underserved in the art community. The works created look *nothing* like the art that went in to train it; only retaining general features such as what the character looks like (which any artist would use), and a light inspiration in terms of style. IE, the exact things someone would copy if creating art in a traditional way.\n",

      "The marketplace for working musicians was changed immensely by recording technology. Recorded music allowed music, once available only via a live musician, to be mass-produced at will by non-musicians. The technology alarmed the music industry, and in 1942, nearly all musicians stopped recording music. This work stoppage wasn't because of WW2; instead, it was a musicians' strike, not technically, but in practice. Nearly all musicians stopped recording music at the end of July 1942 to try to preserve the existing marketplace live music. That boycott ultimately failed. But we've got a 2-year gap in recorded music in history because of this strike. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942%E2%80%931944\\_musicians%27\\_strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942%E2%80%931944_musicians%27_strike)) The strike happened because people feared for their livelihoods. \n",

      "  Generally good points all around OP. Two things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The media coverage lacking nuance isn't special to AI. Media has generally gotten worse at nuance and better at sensationalism. This is squarely on the shoulders of the ad impression-based revenue model. In this model, the companies that cover more sensational news at a faster pace make the most money. Notice I'm not calling the media corrupt or malicious here, because it's not needed for us to get into this unfortunate situation. The ad revenue model is evolutionary pressure that sands away anything besides speed and shock value. If this model bothers you, you could improve your own media diet by finding and supporting a (good) news source that uses an alternative model. So that could be paywalled newspapers, Substack journalists, Patreon-supported channels, etc..\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I'd argue AI art *can* take artist's jobs. And it will, there will be a depressing drop in demand for artists. Here's why I think that.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, lots of the most influential art (movies, video games, tv, etc) is produced at the behest of a corporation. And beaurocrats would be more than happy to axe 5 slow but creative artists and replace them with one prompt poker who knows how to cater to the management. They work at a distance from the creative work, and will only see the money saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area that many artists rely on for income is commission work; logos for businesses, art for people who can't draw something themselves, etc.. I imagine that most commissioners, once AI art becomes reliable enough, will stop using human artists, or purchase services that use AI with human \"touch-up\" artists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's true that AI can't imbue intentional meaning into art by itself, and for that reason a human-directed passion project will be more meaningful than an AI's best guess at what a human would do. And a human artist can understand your philosophy and desires, and come up with new perspectives that might represent what you wanted better than you ever could have. But before that's exactly why many people will pick AI over humans: you *don't know* how a human will contribute to your art. Just like you don't know how your life will change when you befriend someone, or make an enemy. AI will be \"safer\". Faster to produce and learn new skills, but lacking the new life experiences which, when brought into contact with yours, might start a chain reaction in your artistic project that turns it into something that is both wildly different and ultimately better than what you would have made otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of AI art is bittersweet. On the plus side:\n",
      "- it makes art easier and more accessible.\n",
      "- some creative masterpieces will be made that would never have existed otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the negative side:\n",
      "- some people who worked very hard to build their skills may lose their jobs.\n",

I see it as an experiment more than anything, like mixing colours or something. When the thought or idea isn't original idk if you can call it art, I'm sure it's difficult to master putting the words in to get something cool looking to come out but ultimately it doesn't really stack up to any other art form. I'm an illustrator so not the most painstaking art to be made, but even then I think there's been thousands of hours honing my skill, figuring out what works for me and how best to express my vision and this just doesn't feel the same. I do art for fun now, tried everything under the sun and I can say when playing with ai generators it doesn't feel like I'm making art or being creative it feels like I'm mixing paint not painting.

Yes, the people writing these articles about AI art should be doing more research and interviewing all artists, traditional, digital, and AI artists, to gather a more well-rounded understanding of what they are talking about and the issues that are prevalent in all areas of this new kind of art. I don't believe that AI art should be demonized, but I also think it is fair for an artist who is seeing these fantastic art pieces come out of a machine to be scared, especially when many of us have put countless hours into developing our craft, style, and voice. Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of dollars we have also spent on supplies and education. I think that the art world is very gatekept and that we need to be more willing, in general, to open up discourse about art and why things are considered art, and what tools we are using to save time and develop a larger body of work. But we should also be looking at reasons why it is that artists are feeling pressured to create larger bodies of work and why we are pushing artists to produce work at speeds that have many of us looking for tools like AI art to develop that work and keep up with the demands.\n",

      "  So, there's actually three legally-distinct cases with how AI interacts with existing copyright law that we should consider here:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Inspiration\" - the AI does what it's supposed to and generates a completely novel work. The only influence the AI took is uncopyrightable.\n",
      "2. \"Regurgitation\" - the AI just spits out something that was in the training set because the training set is gospel. This is textbook copyright infringement and something we don't want it doing.\n",
      "3. \"Derivation\" - the AI creates a non-identical work based on copyrightable training set data, such as a copyrighted character in a different pose or style. This is also copyright infringement, but one that the AI community doesn't really seem to care about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current discourse surrounding AI is to assume it's entirely novel (\"taking inspiration\"), or entirely copying (\"regurgitating training set data\"). Neither is the case all of the time; how often it will regurgitate vs. generate novel works is dependent on the subject matter of the input prompt. AI users *don't want* training set data, of course; but the system isn't designed to detect if it's just handing that data back to them and thus cannot warn the user about it. You need licensing metadata for that purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, of course, there's also the derivative works problem. A lot of people seem to think that if they tell the art generator to create a novel image of Spongebob Squarepants, then they own that image. That's not how copyright works; if you create new art *recognizably based off of someone else's art* you need permission. If you don't get permission then your ownership over the derivative dissolves away. (This is also why sketchy t-shirt sites like to steal fanart - you can't sue for someone stealing your stolen goods.) If you ask the AI for copyrighted material, even in a novel way, it's still not yours.\n",

      "The way that you'd go about this ethically would be to train an image classifier on the same training set that the art generator saw, and have it designed to detect both individual characters and subjects as well as specific artist styles. This would allow, at the very least, compliance with Creative Commons licensing - the classifier says \"this is a remix of X, Y, or Z\" and the user is told how to comply with the license.

I'm not talking about combining different styles or be inspired by one style alone, that's part of the normal creative process. I think this can become an issue for artists that have an easily recognizable style (for example, Junji Ito). I could do right now an image search of Junji Ito pictures and not tell which is real or AI generated, without previously being a connoisseur of Junji Ito's past works.

Others simply give prompts and let the AI be the artist. Then SD suddenly becomes the most prolific artist of all time, which we then need to consider ownership rights.

      "  You're saying everyone else is anthropomorphizing ai when that's literally what *you're* doing. You're acting as if there will be some moment where ai will be \"real\" and \"like us\", when in reality it's just a variety of mechanical functions that make up the human brain, and some of those functions are replicated in modern ai.\n",
      "\n",
      "> That's the crux of it. Is it AI or is it a noise removal filter that's been \"tricked\" into merging it's training data together.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can describe what you believe the difference is, I'll be happy to answer. The reality is that the AI models *do not have the training set included in them.* idk about you, but all the stable diffusion models I've been using have been less than 4gb, despite being trained on millions of images (which certainly are *not* smaller than 4gb). It's physically impossible for it to be copying from the training set.\n",
      "\n",
      "> If I could somehow go into the AI's weights and replace everything it \"knows\" about circles with squares, would it start generating images with square eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Depends on whether it associated \"circle\" with \"eye\". More advanced/trained models might be able to, but smaller ones might not. But yes, in theory, a model that is sufficiently trained to know that circles are related to eyes, will indeed start generating square eyes if we replace the circle knowledge. That's generally what's going on here. It knows XYZ pixel placement associates with ABC string. but it does that in an insanely complicated way so that various pixel placements can refer to the same string, multiple strings can refer the same set of pixel placements, etc. This is why sometimes you get deformed stuff in the image. The AI *thinks* that's what's associated with your prompt, even though it's incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "> But if it has no relationship between the concept of an eye and a circle, then as far as I can tell that means it's model of an eye is just an average of every eye it's been trained on, and that if you were to look through its training data you would literally find the eye it uses when generating a prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you try to look for content the AI used in a created image, you won't find it. Sufficiently trained AI can create *new* images. For example, say you give it a bunch of pics of pigs. Then you give it a bunch of pics of cows. You can tell the AI to show you a pig that looks like a cow, and it'll do so. Yet nowhere in the training data will you find a pig that looks like a cow. There's nothing \"copied\". You can then train it on van gogh's paintings, and tell it to make that cow-pig in the style of van gogh. Again, you won't find this van gogh cow-pig in any of the training images.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give an *actual* example, I created a model off a particular video game character. I gave it about 100 pics of fan art to work with. The AI managed to generate *real life* style images, despite not being given any such thing. For example, a plushie of the character, or a playdough type look to the character, despite never having seen any image even remotely like that. It can do this because the base model (stable diffusion) trained enough on the plushie and playdough type images, and then trained on the images of the character. You won't find the pixels or parts of the image copied from anywhere. You can crop a part and search the entire dataset and won't find it. It just took what counts as a \"win\" for plushies, and a \"win\" for the character, and generated an image that satisfied both criteria.\n",

      "It's a bit hard to explain without diving into the technical details, but perhaps think of it like this: imagine you're in a room and you've got some colored pencils and paper in front of you. You're asked to draw a 1930912379. Having no idea what that is, you just draw some random thing and submit it. It's wrong. So now you know that it's *not* that. So you try again, drawing something different. And... wrong again. Eventually you end up drawing a circle, and that's correct. Then you get another number 0291237. This time you try drawing the circle and.... half correct. So you try making additions to the circle, and okay now it's correct. So now you know what to draw when you get that number again.\n",

      "This is what the AI is doing. And you can literally watch it do this. Just print out various \"steps\" in the creative process. [See here.](https://i.imgur.com/OclNkbF.png) You can see in the first generation, the first step, it looks nothing like a woman. The AI is told \"no this is wrong, do better\", and so it tries again, the second time being a bit closer. Still no, refine it, make it better. So it goes again, and it's starting to look more like a woman. Over time, this image gets refined into something that more properly fits the categorization of the prompt provided. Note how at no point did it \"copy\" anything. It's very much like an artist going over the work, refining it, adding details, etc. That's what the AI is doing: adding details to make it closer fit the prompt. It starts with nothing, and slowly makes it's way to a final image that is satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not \"taking an eye from some image in the data set\". You can literally see *how* it's making the eye. It starts off as random noise, and then slowly gets refined until it meets the criteria of \"eye\". There's simply not enough room for it to be copying pixels anyway. The model is 4gb, while the dataset is probably into the terabytes. It's physically impossible for it to copy any particular eye. It knows what an eye looks like because the weights have been adjusted to say \"yes this is an eye\" for thousands of pictures of eyes, but recognizing \"this is an eye\" is *not* the same as just copy+pasting an eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI creates art by going \"is this an X? no, time to make it better. is this an X? no a bit more. okay this is an X.\" The more eyes you see, the more variety you can have to ensure that \"yes it's an eye\". If you've only ever seen a single eye in your life, then when asked to draw an eye, that's the only thing you could come up with because it's the only reference you have. However, once you get *enough* pictures of eyes, you no longer need any *individual* eye, as you can go \"yeah this is generally eye-like\". Depending on the training set, that \"yes this is eye-like\" may indeed look similar, because that's what it's judging is \"like an eye\". However once you get *enough* variation in the set, the AI can go \"okay I got this\" and you can tell it to do something *new* with the eye, and it'll be able to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, the AI is learning to *recognize* an image as a word/caption, and then *provide* what it *thinks* the word/caption is supposed to look like. With low training data, it'll look closer to the training data. With high amounts of training data, it'll be able to have a lot more variety and flexibility because it can generalize what eyes look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is *exactly* how humans do things. The only difference is that as humans we see everyday things *all the time* and not just through digital images saved on a computer. We have *a lot* more data to work with than the AI does. But it's ultimately the same process: see an image, learn what the caption is related to the image, and then provide what you think the caption looks like.\n",

So stable diffusion with that particular training, which is telling the AI what does a standing person looks like can produce standing people nude, you can dress them, you can arrange them sometimes poorly in different lightings etc.. but if you change the pose too dramatically, that model can't generate the new pose, it creates horrible fleshy nightmares.   \n",

If you make 1000 generations with a specifically trained dreambooth model you find out that there are many repetitions and themes, taken from your images, they are not just shapes or colors or visual materials, you see repeated faces and hands as if the Ai is frankensteining them together.

I can get the frustration when someone gets their style stolen with AI art but lets be real here people are paying for commissions from an artist because its from that artist (assuming they have a name in this came \"SamDoesArt\" does), they could possible get a piece that looks like its from an artist but that has always been a possibility. Noone is going to pay millions of dollars for an imitation that looks like the Mona Lisa or an art piece inspired by divinci. People are paying absurd prices for those art pieces not because the quality but because of who it is from (other possible black market reasons but the main point is stands). Also what is your stance on fan art especially fan art that is trying to mirror the original style of the medium, is that not allowed?

But it all depends on the client, i have clients that just like to see me draw in stream with no other tool than photoshop and cool i can do that as well. Ai is just another tool in my belt. I would not use it for everything, and even when i use it it would never appear that way in my work, and as i say constantly: Visual arts are all about what is seen in your work.

The Foundation of AI isn’t to create word for word, pixel to pixel replicas of what you have given the model but to build from the ground up, as humans we don’t often notice how complex and amazing ourselves are. People might just think we look and hear something and immediately remember it but completely forget how is that even possible? I myself don’t draw, but I would love to learn how to, AI just makes it easy for me to bring concepts and ideas to live. Maybe it isn’t that great yet, for videos, but look at how far we have come? Imagine in the years to come, we can create our own show, anime or movie? Doing these sort of things require millions of dollars. But look for example at Corridor Crew(https://youtu.be/_9LX9HSQkWo?si=DyawH5Ktuk3V9_kB) and how even one Creator/Artist from Disney reacts to it, we are all amazed and excited that now indie teams and smaller creators now can do these things without spending a fortune on them.

      "As much as I can guide an AI model, inpaint, finetune, roto and composite results, color correct, add music sfx, tell a story, etc. its still a different result than if I had made it using a pre2020 workflow, and has a different (not bad or good, just different) facade of authorship to it. The output is inescapably influence by the model’s training, the model’s taste, the mode’s “creativity” which is a large part of authorship imo. The more agency we give AI, the less human we are. It’s a question of how many human faculties am I letting it replace for me? My appearance, my voice, my thinking, creativity, taste, my craft, etc. This is a spectrum, not a binary, but discussion around is always binary. The root of all “AI is bad” arguments boil down to a conscious or unconscious awareness to this threat to one’s humanity, on some level. A threat to the things that make you uniquely human, aka valuable. Those fears are not unfounded. The 3 fears you listed are not unfounded either.\n",

      "  I can see the difference because I've experienced the difference. There is a difference between tools of automation and tools that replace thought and craft in domains that are uniquely human. I've used tools that automate my manual work, and digital tools that replaced physical artmaking, even procedural tools that \"do it for me\" and I can still recognize AI fundamentally impacts the human experience of creativity differently. My argument is, recognizing that difference matters because soon we will forget what it was like before ai. It's a philosophical point but it's bearing is tangible because process impacts results.

He stands confidently beside a large, majestic water dragon, its scales shimmering in shades of deep blue, as if made of pure water.

Of course it’s also important that the character stay the same character. For context, this is for a book, and each pose would serve as a symbolic avatar that labels the accompanying text as “technical,” “interesting,” or “very important.” Children might be helping me with this task, coming up with descriptive text for certain poses, so the simpler the process, the better.

Even specifying it's \"underground\" or \"deep underground\" somehow manifests either sunlit windows or no windows but warm, sunny, apparently sourceless light. I even tried prompts like 'completely dark night' and the 'windows' did indeed show pitch-black, which could have worked... but there was still somehow the glow of sunlight.

I mean, it takes some doing to do worse than fantasy artists trying to paint an archer\n",
