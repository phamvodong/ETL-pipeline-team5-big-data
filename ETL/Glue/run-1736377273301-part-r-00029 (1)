I39m blown away the AI has vision like the terminator and the way it analyses looks exactly like that. Normal AI bosses that attack the same or attack randomly are so tired","I39m glad you guys spent 100bn of investors money to build an AI boss that attacks randomly after doing the same thing for a while.","Healer priority goal unpredictability. A boss that can spam with a single attack throughout the battle is the pinnacle of AI","What39s the fcking point of having a tank on the team if the boss always aggros on the others? At that point","no one will be playing tank","Wow mir5 my love","At least show uS AI BLIND AND AI BLOODAND AI TAIL CUT LEG CUT SO WE CAN KILL IT","This seems predictably unfun.","This sounds so ass","You really have no freaking clue about actual games","do you","Oh crap... A new level of souls like bosses.","This will make the boss unbeatable but don 39t forget they will also develop AI assisting NPCs that will help you as well.

I assumed games were already doing this.","Umm so Dark souls the first few play throughs lol That is hard","Pattern recognition is the whole fun of these types of action games. If the boss does whatever it just becomes frustrating and too luck based. If a pattern based boss is quottoo tediousquot then it39s just a case of being poorly tuned or designed.","If the game is impossible to win","then who would be willing to spend their entire life playing this serious game?","This is PURE GIMMICK. Program the Boss to hit you 2 twice to kill you. Give the Boss ten different forms","with each form having full health.

What39s that?quot","IATX 6090 Future ?","as long as its an auto attack button game it wont matter.","This is stupid. An AI would have an unfair advantage since it is fed with all the data about each opponent such as defence","damage","special abilities","etc. A real enemy would not be able to determine who is a healer or a tank that easily.","I39ve been waiting for this for all my life! Finally!","Nvidia Skynet","Tech like this needs to be eased onto a player base. AI has stagnated for 20 years in large part because actual good AI feels like quotcheatingquot to a lot of players that don39t understand its behavior. Also","players often want to feel powerful and hate being undermined by AI. I think games desperately need better AI","but it needs transparency and should expect to handhold players for a while.","100 this will be another Crypto bot infested scam","PREDICTABILITY IS WHY GAME BOSSES ARE FUN! WTF is this crap!?","well you forgot that people play games for fun","not to have an ai boss defeat them repeatedly","Absolutely NOT","that39s why games have difficulties","As they said in that movie Edge of TomorrowquotAn enemy that can see the future cannot be defeated.quot","AI a href","I guess nobody remembers Alien Isolation.There is nothing new or revolutionary here","just buzzwordy bullshit.","I don39t understand the game with nvidia ace artificial intelligence and boss mechanics","I don39t understand","but there are different technologies in amd gpus","don39t I know that artificial intelligence is always done on the cpu","that is","mob mechanical artificial intelligence and interactions","so if I have an amd gpu","won39t those boss mechanics work for me. or if the amd gpu I use will act like a boss idiot","then wouldn39t it be illogical?","just ai pnj in gta 6","In before people complain of quotAI is stealing our jobsquot","If they39re going to give us ACE powered enemies and bosses at least give us the option to challenge them in a rap battle using a mic","Yea... this is very flawed In a quotrealisticquot learning situation","Asterion has never lost a fight. But it gets to be trained from data based on the fact that it has died 1000s of times before? But if it died","then there shouldn39t be any learning. I.E. Target the healer... which would imply the group should have a way to counter that some form of taunting by the tank","crowd control","etc. quotRealquot AI would know not to fall for a taunt. So do quottaunting skillsquot become irrelevant or do they only work the first time? And if they only work the first time","is that the first time ever for that encounter or for the playergroup who used it before? So many flaws in this.I think the key thing here is to not be predictable. And if that is the case","then isn39t procedural generation good enough? Ah - but that wouldn39t have the fotm buzzord","this sounds objectively unfun lmao. the great thing about boss fights is that you learn how they work and adapt and overcome an enemy way stronger than you. Having the boss go quotfuck youquot and gain new abilities is so dumvb","Fuck Yea!","Please don39t tag miyazakiFromsoftware.","i feel like this would be good for revolutionizing ai in games for the first time since fear","but it should be done before release to refine ai. Unless I39m wrong and this is just pattern adaption with a fancy coat of unoptimized paint","Do these guys really think bosses targeting healers has never been tried? It39s extremely unfun","Well it could feel like a tough pvp fight or like total op bullshit","This doesn39t sound fun. This sounds like it39s impossible to build a strategy without throwing the baby out with the bathwater every time and starting with nothing.","This idea isnt exactly new and can be implemented without these so called Ai tools nvidia.Also","players really dont want this","Despite what they think they want.","None of this is remotely desirable. Predictable","script-based bosses are very important. Devs have had the ability to make enemies smarter and less predictablewithout deep learning for a very long time and they purposefully do not do this because it39s nothing but frustrating for players. And DL-based AI is even worse cuz it can often resort to very un-intuitive and bizarre behaviors that are 39optimal39 for a fast computer","but make little sense to us","or straight up will do things that are super un-fun to deal with even if they39re effective.","it39ll benefit games that39s doesn39t have rpg turn base more.","Nah","I39m good fam","I don39t need this shit.","Speedrunners love this.","As if the challenges presented in this video was ever the challenge when creating boss AI the traditional definition of the term. Maybe Nvidia ACE has use cases","but whatever they are they are not the ones described in this video because these things aren39t things you need quotAIquot the way Nvidia defines it for.","Everything here can be done with scripting and planning in a boss design","this sort of video is here just to sweet talk people that AI is make or break when it39s really not here.","Great","can39t wait to get stuck for months trying to beat an unbeatable boss who adapts to my every strategy in milliseconds. It39s gonna be sooooo much fun","You just know someones gonna figure out how to abuse the ai","Like almost all AI-related things","this looks so generic.","I like this idea! Imagine","a boss that only gets harder the longer the game is out because it can sample millions of encounters with the player base. This leads to a new concept in video games truly un-deafeatable bosses. Imagine a game launching in Dec 2025. Due to increasing difficulty maybe a specific boss on a specific difficulty setting truly becomes seemingly impossible. So certain bosses would get a date associated with them. Last kill 012926","They will use the gamers for training AI","for eventually ...","Does this mean that the AI doesn39t cheat? Just sayin39","Imagine doing a 30 mins raid or dungeon boss and then face the boss and do it for 16 hours straight.. Games like destiny 2","lost ark","TNL..","This is good for soldier enemies","but not good for games like dark souls","so It depends of the game","developer always can decide to use this or not","so no problems there","You join the game late and finally try the boss","its already learnt everything you can think to try from other players and your stuck on the boss for 430 days. xD epic tho","matrix sentinel??","Welcome back Rise of the Robots","Nvidia is now promoting scam for other company. Funny.","AI could be such a cool tool if people actually knew what on earth they are waffling about. Saying Bosses without this are boring is an insult to many games and shows how bad gaming is becoming","This reeks p2w gameplay so nope","I39m switching to AMD. It won39t make quotAIquot go away but I refuse to support this slop.","quotnarrator voicequot recorded while reclining on the latest la-z-boy using a 3.5mm stick microphone.. although something feels off about it.Let39s hope devs realize that lazy audio production does tell us to be weary of their games.","lets go wemix!!!!!!!!!!!","marketing scam detected","Developers need to play more games to understand why that is a bad idea","from the beginning of gaming is possible to make enemies with unpredictable behavior","but that is not fun","unless the boss is slow and players have enough time to react","otherwise the game becomes a random game based on luck.","Guys... the point of a boss is figuring out it39s mechanics and then beating those mechanincs. Not this.","Buzzword the Buzzwords Buzzword 2","That39s pretty cool.","Unless it ressurects","why would it remember past battles? Just to improve difficulty at the cost of realism? I39d rather it only improved during that specific battle","unless ressurection was part of the story itself.","Asterion qui va pouvoir se palucher sur Asterion","et ça c39est beau.","Remember when in 2013 EA had the audacity to release a trailer claiming that fish avoiding the character when you are underwater was a great technical innovation?

I39ve already explained my channel39s deletion","but I39ll do it again .The reason to why it was wiped was due to Jules39 fans harassing me","putting pressure on me and pushing me to my limit up to channel deletion. The blowup of the video took me by surprise and not a good reaction came out of that. People were twisting my words into a web of deceit. My video was originally created to inform her fans and haters about the surface of her art theft while people could RESPECTFULLY share their opinions. It turned into arguments that lasted up to 20 replies at a time with no clear end. It would not touch other exposing evidence doing the opposite of the latter before I blew up like the fake smiles","donation begging and audio theft.More lies have come out and more evidence has been found which I may touch upon with an introduction","analysis","understanding and formed opinion. I may release it in a series of videos","unfortunately not including doodle girl as I39ve wiped out all instances of her. Instead","I39ll consider a tts voice and a little character to go along with it","maybe one similar to the quotfire musicquot portion of the og video.I39ve gone on for too long","a href my sister need to go there","Girl I love your hair btw","I never realized that Jules could plagiarize. I have always seen her as a beautiful soul but this changes my perspective completely. We should appreciate that she admitted it was an act of theft","and credited the artist. I don39t want to start an argument in the comments","and just wanted to share my pov . Hope this comment is not 2 long!","The glazers n glazin outta hand and its like they worship jules lol- plus shes so annoying","I hate Jules so this whole vid is true","You addressed the situation very good","although some people are going crazy and completely forgetting shes a minor. I dont support her for stealing the art","but its disgusting how there are some adults or even people older than her calling her the most inappropriate things just because she stole someones art. People are saying she should just quit and everything like that. Art theft is disrespectful and Jules shouldnt have done it","but thats not a reason to harass her like full on call her bad words I saw a few comments on posts that Im sure are deleted saying these types of stuff. If you wanna be the mature person","dont say things like that. Also thanks for addressing the art theft","I was really confused when I saw it on Pinterest and then Jules posting it on her channel.","Hey please see this! Im subbed to Jules and really like her content. I am Christian also","but thats what making me ask should I unsub to her? Stealing is bad and so is lying! Any help would be appreciated.","PLEASE EXPOSE PAUL HE IS ACCTULLY SO RASIST","I literally hate how some people use their religion as an excuse","like I39m not Christian but why are you trying to use Jesus as it39s okay for art stealing and he39ll forgive me. Please leave religion out of random topics like art theft","god damn.","her smiling is starting to scare me like a lot bc she smiles like way to much and its starting to make me feel uncomfortable. and she laugh and smiles at everything with me js sitting there with a straight face. its kinda creepy","FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT","Props to you for posting this","just gained a new subscriber","ngl the way that she convinces everyone who hates on her that shes a victim like when someone calls her out","People who do this annoy me so much omg","Heres The thing","Im not saying its your fault or anything. But yall always coming at people when they coming up big","in the mean time yall dont care","your just meat riding people at this point","like okay girl we get its wrong","but it was someone else you wouldnt care","like looks like your only trying to get clout ??? Its not cute nor entertaining","Somone send to her insane asylum Im crying these fans must be bots","im just posting to support!","Girly I saw a video about u tommorow I agree","Does anyone notice how she looks like just like Ariel O","I always didnt like her since she felt off.. i think now i have a reason","I swear her fans are in a cult","I love your dog !!!it39s so cute!!!!!","Omg","literally not her changing her story 20 times..","I am in enemy territory","Ok Teagan","why are you beefing with a 15 year old? Seriously childish though. Like leave this girl alone. Its a waste of time to make this video in my opinion.","NO BRO I ALWAYS FELT LIKE SHE WAS a href GUT IS RIGHT FOR ONCE???I DIDNT WANT BELIEVE IT CAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS JUST JEALOUS OT WHATEVER","I never expected this of her..? Im sorry","Just jules never replys to comments that give her the best compliments I think we owe sigma boy girl a sincere apology because jules is horrible","But if its a one time thing that was months ago and she apologized and explained everything","why keep bringing it up? Like who knows what could be going on at home? Sure she could be a really terrible person who does all of this for awful reasons","but she could also be in a potentially bad family situation","and no traveling often and does not mean she has a good family situation. Im not saying that stealing art is okay","and I am not hating on you. I am merely trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. All we see of Jules is her YouTube self","we have a mere glimpse of her life. And theres probs a lot of things wrong with her","sure","but were human","and Jesus would want us to forgive. Of course shes going to bring up Jesus in her apology","because shes Christian. And I mean we all make mistakes","why not try to forgive her? I dunno","I just think we could give her the benefit of the doubt since shes honestly still young. Sorry for the rant","this is not against you. This is merely my opinion and what I believe. Have a blessed daynight","Hii story time when I was little I was trying out different art styles and I would take VERY similar inspiration and I posted one it took so long and I was SOO proud of myself and every one in the comments were bullying me and at the time I didnt know how to give creds and I ripped my drawing and deleted the vid and cried I still feel bad abt it","I always didnt like justjules and uses ai to reply to comments and brags about going on vacation like all the time","I never really had a problem with her. I didnt hate her nor was I a big fan. I havent checked her channel much but for some reason whenever I saw her i just noticed she felt a bit off. I also used to have a bit of respect for her because she was running a big channel at 15. But knowing that she stole someone elses art makes me lose that respect. Im an artist and we work hard on our art. It takes YEARS to be at the very least decent at art. And even though what she did was bad apologizing about the issue would fix all this. Shes putting more energy into defending herself than she is for making up for it. Just admit that what you did was wrong and move on from it.","Thank you for bringing this to light and standing up for yourself. So many people are brainwashed by these big creators","especially ones like Jules. Theres always been something slightly off to me abt her so Im glad people are seeing her in true light now","Idc ur really pretty","It39s not like she did I on purpose","an people can recreate art without actually tracing it","im honestly jealous like she always goes on vacations and meets other celebs it makes me jealous idk why","personally never liked jules.","guys ik she in art theif but dont be hard on her she just 14 or 15","I always knew there was something off about her from the beginning","I started watching her and then I got bored of her since it was always the same stuff and she was so fake and yk always bringing up her religion which is fine I guess but I dont believe in it","but its more abt the fact shes fake","The glazers on Jules is insane I really dont like her","Guys dont trust her cus she stole someones art and she is an art thief onlineBecause when she gets caught she uses Jesuss name like this I believe Jesus will forgive me like wtfU cant use his name like that u have to repent irl nor just say it on social media like huh?And she can brainwash u into her vids and act like she did nothing I found this girl who was making a vid about her Check her out and u will find the truth! TeaganAnn","Ty I hate this girl thank you thank you thank you","I was watching this on my phone my friend said quotNo she39s not!quot","Im not trying to glaze jules or anything but shes a kid like most of us trying to follow her dreams and wanting to make smiles on peoples face","at least dont try to shut her down I mean a lot of people have done that and their famous and we dont make a big deal about so?","Oop","Thank god I thought i was the only one who thought something was weird about her like why is there so much people glazing her and giver her money","they shouldn39t be giving money to a random person who probably thinks their better because they got to collage and 14.","Her comment section always glaze her like mad And shes always get donations Theres somthing off abt her Her smile and laugh are so fake as well","Stop being mean to Jules","so sorry thats happening also i love ur rottwielers mine passed away at js 2 years old","Tbh I dont think Jules is necessarily a bad person I think shes sweet BUT her fans are turning CRAZY they just GLAZE everything she does even if its not that good. It kinda reminds me of how the Taylor Swift craze was I mean shes good but its a bit over the top.","dang she already in a drama and 2025 just started","Hi yall uhm we dont know if Jules did recreate it","she mgiht ahvew e dont know if shes a good sketcher","Gosh Ive always found her annoying. Im so glad people are finally calling her out Its also a constant pattern when a big creator gets into a problem","Jesus is brought up.

And whats wrong with talking about our King??","Ive always found her weird..","Can you pls do harper zilmer next??","I hate jules because like she always lies and she steals videos she just steals all day ur beautiful","Naw crazy how people are literally blind falling for this idiot","she literally smiles a few times and gets huge donations from kids omgfsdjklskjiyf","The fact y39all are getting a 13 year old wait let me re word that a 13 year old stealing art is wild not but I hope you guys don39t take the extra mild of hating tho","Did u forget that YouTube sometimes turns off comments..","IMA SuB","Like i always wondered WHAT it was","not IF it was there","but i KNEW that something or another was off about that girl. She seems really fake and gets caught lying way more than a Christian like her should","which she claims to be. Also anyone else noticed her much her cult of 8 year olds donate to her?? A little suspicious if you ask me. I swear","her fake smile has got everyone fooled","Guys please stop hating and act more mature JustJules is a human like you guys. This YouTuber is a good YouTuber but I don39t like hate","Bro jules thinks just because she has 3M subs she thinks she a og but she is cringe as hell what did jesus had to do in all this","Oh wow","I used to follow Jules on my other account and generally liked her a bit but there was a side of me that couldn39t stand her and thought I was being dumb for hating? someone for no reason but now I see I39m not the only one xd","whatever thats every creator. they get too arrogant and cocky. also as a christian myself i dont think its wrong for her to say quotjesus forgivesquot but when someone uses it as an excuse not saying she did for their sinwrongs its not okay. bc u still sinned!!!","FINALLY SOMEONE IS TALKING ABT HER! SHE WAS ALWAYS OFF","We have the same name","Frr she39s always showing off her stuff and apparently has quotstrictquot parents when she gets to travel the word and always getting the letter quotmquot in those soulmate filters as in Maxwell.

And dragging religion into everything like she does is so horrible and it NEEDS to stop","justjules fans r acc annoying asf. say the SMALLEST thing about jules wrong they finna find your whole address","Im so happy u posted the vid again! all the justjules glazers cant stand the truth","Guys why are we hating on Jules what about other youtubers they might also steal art i mean I39m a fan but please don39t hate on me or her i just don39t see what39s the big deal sorry for typing this comment but i just wanted to say if you don39t have nothing nice to say then don39t say it.","Tbh thats crazy to a yt that has many fans and lied out flat","quoti reported you xoxo and my family i have 7 siblingsquot good for you ig?
