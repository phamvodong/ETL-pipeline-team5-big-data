    "Hana Fleur yes",
    "you are",

    "i feel really sorry for those prompters",

    "making actual art with AI is hard",
    "and you need to have information on photography and painting to be able to do it perfectly",

    "Paw Christian Kruse Real artists don't create unique works?",

    "Paw Christian Kruse comedian spotted",
    "AI artist sympathyzers\\nlol",

    "Juan Antonio Lucero Saucedo that is not entirely correct",

    "I may be old school",
    "but I believe any amount of AI",
    "especially for the drawing (!!) isn’t authentic- at all. I’ve never used any computerized aid with any work- it feels like cheating to me. It’s no longer art. It’s something completely different. So call it that- AI generated… {not art}.\\nMaybe that’s just me…",
    "I believe that genuine art can only be created by someone whose personality is part of it. AI doesn’t have this. It is lazy ‘art’. It insults real talent.",

    "Michelle Tulumello There is SOOOO SOOOOO SOOOO much more to AI than creating scenes out of nothing. That is just a small tip of it. If you have played around with Photoshop AI in that aspect (creating an entire scene).... you would soon realize it SUCKS. You are lucky to get something recognizable. Every time Adobe updates that part of their AI",
    "they make it worse.",

Adobe isn’t what it used to be. This also interferes with client work because random stuff is labeled A.I. on social media which is NOT and A.I. junk isn’t. For an actual artist this is pretty much a death sentence in their art. We won’t post good work.",

    "Jay Boushard adobe is a whole suite. What do you use to edit your images.",

    "but not to create so-called \"art\".",
    "James Deal problem is companies don’t care about good as much as there care about “good enough”if it’s cheap. AI can be subscribed to cheap and all you need is one artist to do corrections whilst replacing an entire studio worth of designers. AI endgame isn’t to have a new tool for creatives to learn",

    "Brock Kowalsky technology has already severely damaged the photography industry with the quality of cell phone photography not to mention apps that do things it took me hours to do in PS .. many industries are changing …",
    "Brock Kowalsky Graphic design is dead. I had to leave this career when I was competing with designers in other countries willing to work for $5 an hour. Now I am doing marketing data analytics. I will cancel my Adobe subscription when it expires later this year which was way overpriced.",
    "Brock Kowalsky Maybe. But no one wanted to hire me. I did work part time at a furniture hardware store a few years ago using a 10 year old iMac and a 15 year old copy of Indesign and Photoshop. I also had to deliver food. So it is dead to me. Now I am working in data analytics at a ecommerce company where our graphic designer lives in Ukraine.",
    "Brock Kowalsky that's what they said when the computer got rid of typesetters. ai goonna just manage design p[rojects and crank out images all by itself? a person still needfs to run the ai.. could you use AI to do surgery or would a surgeon benefit from using AI?",
    "Brock Kowalsky or they can learn to adapt to.new tools",
    "as many have already",
    "I hate this. They should have made AI learn how to do laundry or wash the dishes. Not art. Anything but art.",

My 2 cents on it is if you’re artistically inclined anything is a tool to create art be it pen and ink or a computer. As with any tool you must know how to use it to get the exact results you are trying to achieve.\\nReally generative art should improve already talented artists as it can help you flesh out your ideas and give perspective.

  "title": "Not a post I wanted to make, but I feel it's super necessary to spread awareness. \nLately in several groups I'm in, people have been trying to sell AI \"art\" as legitimate handmade art, especially pet portraits. This is a very popular scam lately and I've seen in not in just one group, but in several of my groups- some of them not even art-related groups. \nAI \"art\" is computer generated. It is free, but there is no effort, no talent, no artist, no one being supported. It is lifeless, soulless, and very easy to spot by someone with a trained eye. To sell AI \"art\" as legitimate is a scam in every way imaginable. To buy AI \"art\" is to buy garbage. To \"make\" AI art is to steal from hardworking artists.

  "title": "Somewhere today, a builder is finishing work on a beautiful handcrafted home that has taken them a year of labor to complete. A baker is putting the final touches on an amazing cake, their finest work ever. An artist is placing the final stones in an intricate mosaic work. Just a year ago these creations would be fawned over and widely appreciated, inspiring others to dream and to create.\nBut somewhere else today, a lazy individual with no talent is typing keyword prompts into an artificial intelligence photo image generator. In just a few moments the computer will shit out a photo realistic image created solely by AI. Fake cabins, fake cakes, and fake art. They will then create a social media page and upload them. These fake images will be shared a million times and receive hundreds of likes and comments praising the \"work\" and \"creativity\". The person who uploaded them will receive a handsome payout from all the social media engagement you've cheerfully given them with your well intentioned likes and shares. They will then upload even more of these images, flooding our screens with things that don't exist but appear to.\nAI \"art\" is garbage. It is soulless. It is uninspired. It took no effort to create. There is no love, no labor, no sweat or tears. It is destroying social media, destroying the livelihoods of artists, and crushing our collective creative spirits. Why bother to try and create anything real if the results will never be able to compete with AI? Why put in the effort?\nStop rewarding these AI \"creators\". Learn to recognize AI. Share real things. Real pictures. Real work. Real art. Call out your friends when they share this fake drivel. Peer pressure them into rethinking what they share.

  "content": "Somewhere today, a builder is finishing work on a beautiful handcrafted home that has taken them a year of labor to complete. A baker is putting the final touches on an amazing cake, their finest work ever. An artist is placing the final stones in an intricate mosaic work. Just a year ago these creations would be fawned over and widely appreciated, inspiring others to dream and to create.\nBut somewhere else today, a lazy individual with no talent is typing keyword prompts into an artificial intelligence photo image generator. In just a few moments the computer will shit out a photo realistic image created solely by AI. Fake cabins, fake cakes, and fake art. They will then create a social media page and upload them. These fake images will be shared a million times and receive hundreds of likes and comments praising the \"work\" and \"creativity\". The person who uploaded them will receive a handsome payout from all the social media engagement you've cheerfully given them with your well intentioned likes and shares. They will then upload even more of these images, flooding our screens with things that don't exist but appear to.\nAI \"art\" is garbage. It is soulless. It is uninspired. It took no effort to create. There is no love, no labor, no sweat or tears. It is destroying social media, destroying the livelihoods of artists, and crushing our collective creative spirits. Why bother to try and create anything real if the results will never be able to compete with AI? Why put in the effort?\nStop rewarding these AI \"creators\". Learn to recognize AI.

And what about the many devious things people can do with ai generating horrible inappropriate images of them like making them nude or making them say horrible things is that not harmful?

    "Trey Logan I can understand why people would be upset if corporations instead of using artist started just buying an AI image software and all kind of people were out of work that makes sense. What does it make sense is when you use it in a joking way in your messages and act like it's taking money from people. I could get a camera and take a picture of everyday objects label them and then the AI would then put those images together to make art when you ask it to make a picture it's not stealing artwork from other artists like everybody's claiming.",
