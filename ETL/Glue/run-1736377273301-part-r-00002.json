At the moment","I can't help but feel like AI isn't living up to its full potential. Just doing imitation/replacement/augmenting is understandable since its new","but its also kind of lame honestly.\\n\\nFor example","the now defunct youtube animation storytime community is extremely bottlenecked by the animation side of things. While AI is still rather poor at animation","given that it can make colored","shaded backgrounds quickly","it could be interesting to say","dramatically reduce the months long turn around time to maybe close to weeks by using new technologies like pngtuber software with AI backgrounds/props and combining that with aftereffects & photoshop.\\n\\nJust some composite","multi-medium usage versus direct AI output","Love this. I think these are all really smart points. The two characters visiting the museum is a great analogy and way to describe the myth vs. reality.\\n\\nAlso at around 11:38 you state that raw AI output is ok if you have loose requirements","but when you are aiming to make something specific","it requires a lot of work. Most people who are afraid of losing their jobs are not aware of this fact. They think you can type a few words into a prompt box and get exactly what you have in mind. You can't","and they probably only think this because they have never tried to get something highly specific. Anyone who is paying for art wants something highly specific","so you will HAVE to art direct it.\\n\\nThe one thing I would disagree about is that you shouldn't use (living) artists' names in your prompts. As you noted","when you create an image","you are not using pieces of an artist's work","you are using parameters of how they make their work. In other words","you are using their influence. And artists have been influencing each other for thousands of years. I don't see why we should stop now. Personally","I feel that if you want to be original you will not *want* your work to look exactly like another artist's work. But I do think you might want your color palette to resemble a certain artist","your line work to resemble a different artist","your composition to resemble a third artist and so forth. In other words","you may want to digest the work of several artists to invent something new. That is what all artists do.\\n\\nThank you for making this!","Honestly","good video and even I\\'m professional artist","sadly I don\\'t share some of her points (some yes","some nope).\\n\\nNow that everybody is talking about ethics here and there","I will be interested too in \"using art in an ethical way\". And not","I\\'m not joking saying this. There is a big gap in fan art","inspiration","etc. behind the ethic word.\\n\\nEdit: Now I have time.\\n\\nThere are some things that for me are still a bit nonsense","for example:\\n\\nFirst. The most clear one. The not prompting artists names \"rule\". Ok","and I ask","why? Most of people mix 3","4","5 and even more artists names to get something entirenly different to each of those artists prompted. I can understand the point of not prompting an artist name (understand but not agree with) but when used in combination? This was a false statement like the collage one (thanks for pointing that one) and also it won\\'t work cause for style LORA\\'s as you can see no one or almost anyone is prompting artist names anymore and they\\'re being represented so... Nah","won\\'t work.\\n\\nAlso I want to add a thing. Even you\\'re not prompting artist names you\\'re dragging the SD dataset (Lion/Open) everytime you prompt anything so yeah","you may not prompt Rembrandt but if you prompt features inherent to his style","he will appear. Same for every other single artist you can think of. The only thing here is the changes are less to happen but you\\'re not doing a safe measure at 100%. Hope this is clear.\\n\\nSecond. Artists getting paid for being \"prompted\". IMO chaotic and will lead to people train more loras","textual inversions","etc. (to NOT pay them) which things like gr3rutk0swk","etc. And this will lead also to WAY MORE style represented of those (and that\\'s what theorically they don\\'t want). And well.. in the case this happens","I suppose the old masters should also be getting paid and every single artist they have been inspired by since that\\'s the same behaviour as AI.\\n\\nThird. Totally agree by the way with training your own works but I think not everyone here is an artist and a lof of them are casual people that are just having fun with SD. That\\'s a mistake I did when started my Patreon and focused of training my own 3D models","illustrations","paintings and so on..","I thought of SD as an arsenal kit for professional artists use and even I created some valuable things most of people found that they were only for artists and I had to open more my mindset and undertand that NOT EVERYONE HERE KNOWS TO DRAW","PAINT or MODEL. Took me a while and it\\'s common this to happen. Thanks to everyone who told me this","I was being delusional.\\n\\nFour. The relationship of the things (first point of the video). 100% true and agree but I can tell you as a person heavily involved in AI since 10 months ago... this will change. Now hands are bad","fingers are bad","toes also","same for some relations... you just need to see MidJourney and how they improved. And yes","SD is not MJ","ok BUT if you look a bit in the history of SD","there is always couple KEY things every months MJ used and appears to SD \"openly\". It\\'s not a conspiracy","it\\'s pretty clear that every month or x time","we get \"oh","so this is what they used for...","first was the Noise Offset","etc.\\n\\nAs you can see I agree on almost everything on how to use and see AI and SD but some points for me will be impossible to correlate with copyright without end in madness. The solution for copyright some people are \"offering\" will only cause chaos in digital art and yes","I\\'m pointing to Karla Ortiz and her friends joining C.A. as the threat to the art itself.","Really fantastic video that","as you say","is able to recognize both the good and bad.\\n\\nI think the OpenAI CEO said something very similar to your thinking yesterday - the AI today can be used to do certain tasks","but it is not able to do a job.\\n\\nOn LAION-B","just a detail and I think most are aware of it","but this dataset itself does not contain the actual images so there is no ethical concern with it. The problem rather comes in when the training of the models download and process the same images.\\n\\nI never reflected on how much of LAION-B is copyrighted but I could see that even if it is just 10 %","that can be a serious problem. It would be interesting to see how well some Stable Diffusion-like models do when trained only on public data.\\n\\nI'm sure you have also already explored these models a lot already but for img2img","you can generally get better results by significantly increasing the number of steps (40-80) and using a lower denoising factor (eg 0.3-0.5) (eg for your own compositions).","I work with Bard to construct my prompts.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple way to get a particular artist\\'s style output without using their names:\\n\\nOpen Bard","or any chatbot","and ask for information about a particular artist.\\n\\nThroughout this summarized response you will have a template of keywords describing the artist and their particular styles of artwork.\\n\\nNext ask for a list of similar artists.\\n\\nFinally","ask for the commonalities between the styles of the various artists. For example","you could say:\\n\\n\"Find the commonalities between the styles of Pablo Picasso","Vincent van Gogh","Claude Monet","Frida Kahlo","and Andy Warhol.\"\\n\\nNow you have a generic template free of plagiarism. \\n\\nHope this helps!","Using AI is absolutely ethical.

{"id":"143gnpo","title":"I'm Anti AI art. I saw this posted on the AIwars subreddit. I was wondering what you guys think of this? As I have mixed feelings.","content":" \nNot everyone's way of thinking and appreciating works the same. I'm an artist, but I've never enjoyed the process. I'm a very anxious person and procrastinator, so I've always had to take advantage of the initial impulse to push myself to finish something I have in my head before the motivation fades away. Since I was a kid I always wished for some kind of power or technology to be a shortcut between a possibility inside of my head and the ending result. So many amazing ideas inside of my head that no one ever got to see because I never got to actually create them in any shape or form. This is not the case anymore, because even if vague, now I can write my ideas down and get a grasp of what they would look like. To me this is very pleasant. I understand this is not the typical thing you would hear from an artist, but I have actually worked as an artist and designer for more than 10 years now. I enjoy AI so much... And at the same time understand the risks of this. On the other hand, what everyone mentions about the \"meaning\", I'll be honest, not every piece of art is meant to be appreciated as such. I think about movies, comics, even music. I enjoy what my sight and hearing can perceive and I couldn't possibly care less who created it or what was their purpose. I only care what it means to me. And in 10 years of creating art for videogames, no matter what anyone says, my experience is that what matters to the consumer is the final product not where it came from. So, the \"soul\" of a piece is not important for everyone, I would even date to say it is not important for most people, so in a world driven by consumerism, AI generation makes a lot of sense.

{"id":"1456i9z","title":"Midjourney's role in the SPFBO controversy","content":"An artist named Sean Mauss won a cover art contest for a fantasy book, \"Bob the Wizard\", in an event called the Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO). However, people on Twitter started questioning if he used artificial intelligence (AI) to help create his artwork, which was against the rules of the contest. After examining evidence, such as similarities between his work and images from an AI system called Midjourney, it seemed like Mauss did use AI.\nThis revelation caused quite a stir. Mauss withdrew his submission, deactivated his social media, and his personal website went offline. Mark Lawrence, who ran the SPFBO contest, not only disqualified Mauss's entry but also decided to stop running the cover art contest altogether to avoid similar issues in the future. This controversy has ignited a larger conversation about the role of AI in art and publishing, with some people worried that it's becoming harder to tell if a work is human-made or AI-generated.\n**why is this important?**\nThis incident is important because it highlights a significant issue in the world of art and publishing: the role and influence of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, it can generate content that seems to be created by a human, causing challenges in industries that value original human-made work.\nIt raises questions about authenticity, the value of human effort, and how to distinguish between human-created and AI-generated work. Also, it can cause legal and ethical issues, especially if AI-generated work is misrepresented as entirely human-made, like in this case.\nThis is a pivotal moment for industries like art and publishing to set guidelines and standards for the use and identification of AI-generated content, which will have far-reaching implications as AI continues to evolve.\n**what are the potential implications of this?**\n1. **Authenticity and Trust**: If the source of artwork (or any creative content) is misrepresented, it could erode trust within the industry. Consumers and publishers may doubt the authenticity of the work they purchase or promote.\n2. **Regulation and Policies**: This incident could lead to stricter guidelines and regulations about the use of AI in art and publishing. Rules might be enacted requiring clear disclosure if AI tools are used, potentially influencing contest rules, submission guidelines, or contractual agreements between artists and their clients.\n3. **Economic Impact**: The use of AI could disrupt the economics of creative industries. AI can potentially produce high volumes of content at a lower cost than human artists, potentially devaluing human-made work or leading to job displacement. However, it could also open up opportunities for new kinds of creativity and innovation.\n4. **Technical Development**: Demand for better AI detection tools may increase. While tools already exist, their reliability can be improved, and incidents like this underline their necessity.\n5. **Legal Issues**: Misrepresenting AI-generated work as human-made could lead to legal issues around copyright and intellectual property rights. Who owns the rights to AI-generated work is a contentious issue and legal frameworks might need to evolve to accommodate these cases.\n6. **Artistic Evolution**: As AI becomes more integrated into creative processes, the definition of \"art\" and \"creativity\" may evolve. This could lead to new forms of expression and collaboration between humans and AI, potentially transforming artistic norms and expectations.\nThis literally just happened if you want to know about AI art tools immediately, they drop [here first](https://www.thepowerup.ai/subscribe).

{"id":"145chko","title":"you can finally do generative fill for free","content":"StabilityAI just announced the Uncrop tool.\nImagine you've taken a photo with your camera or phone, and you love the picture, but you just wish there was a bit more sky, or a little more scenery to the left or right. This is where Clipdrop's new tool, Uncrop, comes in.\nYou just upload your photo into the tool and it will work.\nThis tool uses stable diffusion to guess what the rest of the photo might have looked like if it was bigger.\nThe AI looks at your photo, figures out what's in it (like trees, buildings, people, etc.), and then generates more of the same to add to the edges. This is called \"outpainting\", like the tool is painting outside your original picture. It's a bit like how an artist might look at a small part of a landscape, and then imagine what the rest of the scene looks like.\n**what are the implications of a tool like this?**\n1. **Enhanced Creative Freedom:** With this tool, photographers and designers can reframe or adjust images after they have been taken. This added flexibility could result in more aesthetically pleasing compositions and could make the job of graphic designers and photo editors much easier.\n2. **Improved Content Adaptation:** Uncrop can be used to adapt images for different platforms with varying aspect ratios. For instance, if a business wanted to use the same image for an Instagram post (which favors a square aspect ratio) and a Twitter post (which favors a more rectangular aspect ratio), they could use Uncrop to adjust the image appropriately.\n3. **Potential Misuse:** With the power to realistically modify and expand images, there's also a risk of misuse. The tool could potentially be used unethically to alter images without viewers knowing.\n4. **Increased Accessibility:** By providing such a powerful tool for free and via a web interface, more people are able to access and utilize advanced AI capabilities, democratizing access to these tools.\n5. **AI Progress Indicator:** Finally, a tool like Uncrop serves as an indicator of the progress being made in AI technology, demonstrating AI's increasing ability to generate realistic, high-quality images from existing content.\nYou can use [Uncrop for free](https://clipdrop.co/uncrop), without even having to make an account.\nThis tool literally just came out.

We used our words like paintbrushes, our thoughts like free spirits, and our technology like tools. We created a masterpiece of our own design, a work of art that would last for all to see.\n-Aristarchus & Bard\n06/04/23\n\nApproximately half of this gallery was produced utilizing the poem as the positive prompt. \n\nNegative Prompt:\n\nThe artwork avoids the pitfalls of bad art, such as ugly and deformed eyes and faces, poorly drawn, blurry, and disfigured bodies with extra limbs and close-ups that look weird. It also avoids other common issues such as watermarking, text errors, missing fingers or digits, cropping, poor quality, and JPEG artifacts. The artwork is free of signature or watermark and avoids framing issues. The hands are not deformed, the eyes are not disfigured, and there are no extra bodies or limbs. The artwork is not blurry, out of focus, or poorly drawn, and the proportions are not bad or deformed. There are no mutations, missing limbs, or floating or disconnected limbs. The hands and neck are not malformed, and there are no extra heads or out-of-frame elements. The artwork is not low-res or disgusting and is a well-drawn, highly detailed, and beautiful rendering. \n\nThe Debate Over AI Art Collaboration✌\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83E\uDD16\uD83C\uDFA8\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world, and the arts are no exception. AI is now being used by artists to create new and exciting forms of art, and to expand the boundaries of creativity.\n\nTraditionally, artists have collaborated with each other in a variety of ways. For example, they might collaborate on a painting, sculpture, or performance piece. They might also collaborate on a project that involves research, such as a documentary film or a historical novel.\n\nIn traditional collaboration, artists work together to share ideas, feedback, and skills. This can lead to new and exciting ideas that may not have been possible if the artists had worked alone.\n\nAdditionally, traditional collaboration can free up artists' time by allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of their work, while other team members handle tasks such as marketing, promotion, and distribution.\n\nAI collaboration can offer similar benefits.\n\nIn many ways, collaborating with AI is similar to traditional collaboration. Both involve working with others to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts. However, there are also some important differences.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is that AI can spark new ideas and various new styles for the artist. This can lead to new and exciting forms of art that would not have been possible without AI.\n\nAnother difference is that AI can automate tasks that would be time-consuming or difficult for humans to do. This can free up the artist's time to focus on more creative aspects of their work.\n\nI believe that traditional collaboration and AI collaboration can complement each other. Artists can use AI to generate new ideas and possibilities, and they can use traditional collaboration to get feedback on their work and to develop their ideas further. \n\nThe debate over AI art collaboration is likely to continue for many years to come. However, one thing is clear: AI is already having a significant impact on the art world, and its influence is only likely to grow in the years to come. \n\nI am excited to see how artists will use AI in the future to create new and innovative forms of art. AI has the potential to revolutionize the art world, by making it easier for artists to create, collaborate, and share their work. \n\n-Aristarchus & Bard\n06-09-23\n\nThanks for reading!

While we understand the need for Reddit to sustain its platform, we believe this rule poses potential financial burdens for developers and may restrict the accessibility and diversity of apps that enhance the Reddit experience.\nDuring the restricted period, we aim to raise awareness about the implications of this new rule and encourage open discussions among our community members. We believe in fostering an inclusive and accessible environment for everyone, and we want to ensure that the voices and perspectives of all Redditors are heard. We encourage you to share your thoughts, concerns, and ideas during this time and work together to find constructive solutions that benefit both the Reddit community and its developers.\nRest assured, we are actively monitoring the situation and engaging with other subreddit communities, developers, and Reddit administrators to address these concerns. Our aim is to create a dialogue that promotes understanding, cooperation, and a sustainable approach to the future development of third-party apps on Reddit. \nWe appreciate your understanding and support during this time, and we look forward to continuing our journey together.\n&#x200B;\nSincerely,\nThe r/aiArt Moderation Team\n\\---\n1.

While there may be some similarities between their concerns and those of anti-AI art people, it's not accurate to use the same term. :3\nSecond, labeling these individuals as Luddites can create negative biases against them and distance them from the rest of us. This is unhelpful as many of them have reasonable concerns about the impact of AI on our society.\nFor instance, one of the biggest concerns is job security. It's understandable that people are worried about their livelihoods and we should be discussing this issue in a serious manner instead of acting like they’re idiots. Maybe we could pressure our capitalist overlords to treat artists better? There’s no reason why this new technology has to become the future by stepping on artists’ throats.\nAnother important issue is the role of corporations in shaping our tools. Our tools shape how we think and we need to ask ourselves if we want corporate tools to be the ones shaping our thinking. I’m not saying that using MidJourney makes you evil or something. Just that we shouldn’t be forming dependencies on closed source software. We’re trying to democratize art, right? \nSo let's avoid using the term Luddites, and instead just call them anti-AI activists or something more properly descriptive, alright?","comments":["Ive never been one for name calling myself. Makes us sound like the morons who stubbornly adhere to political sides like Hockey teams rather than taking a nuanced look at policy.","I think we need to recognize that this is a conflict on two(three?) fronts that is being packaged into one.There's the conflict of AI versus 'art","and AI versus the 'artistic industry'.I admit that the danger of calling them luddites is that it threatens to blur the lines between separate perspectives","simply because they seek heavy (possibly total in some cases) AI regulation.\\n\\n\\\\[+X\\\\] There are those who focus on art as a medium of expression.\\\\[-X\\\\] There are those who focus on artistic work as a commodity.\\n\\n\\\\[+Y\\\\] There are those who think AI is capable of 'art' or assisting in making good 'art'.\\\\[-Y\\\\] There are those who think AI is incapable of 'art' or assisting in making good 'art'.\\n\\n\\\\[+Z\\\\] There are those who think AI will destroy the artistic capitalist industry.\\\\[-Z\\\\] There are those who think AI will be a positive boon to the industry.\\n\\nBy using terms like 'Tech bro' and 'Luddite' we are removing nuance from conversation (not saying it's solely one sides fault. Any side that refuses to acknowledge the technical/ethical/social complexity of how AI will undoubtedly leave its mark on art and the artistic industry is in the wrong).","Will they stop calling me \"AI bro\"?","Some words have more than one meaning and the term Luddite has developed a definition other than the actual historical group.\\n\\n>Oxford dictionary: a person opposed to new technology or ways of working.\\n\\n>Merriam Webster: one who is opposed to especially technological change\\n\\n>Ex. The Luddite argued that automation destroys jobs.\\n\\nAnd yes that was the dictionary example not mine","looks quite consistent with an argument made by the anti-AI position.","I agree","because that\\'s some very harmful generalization - the \"luddites\" all have different motives and conclusions.  \\nThey have different motives:\\n\\n* some believe that art is inherently how a human expresses themselves\\n* some are concerned about the ethics of AI training","and the artist\\'s consent\\n* some are worried that img2img can launder copyright","or be abused for commissions\\n* some are against a few mega corps potentially taking control of the majority of commercial art\\n* some worry about the disappearance of the concept of \"audience\" as all content becomes atomically targeted\\n\\nAnd more importantly","they have different conclusions:\\n\\n* AI art generators should be banned entirely\\n* corporations must not use AI art","individuals is okay\\n* using someone else\\'s art as an input for img2img is not okay","everything else is fine\\n* AI art is okay as long as it is not sold\\n* AI art is fine if you clearly state that it is AI art","and some human work is involved (e.g. as an asset in a game)\\n* AI art should not be copyrighted\\n* AI art generators should credit the original images used in training and compensate accordingly\\n* AI art is not evil","but we should be cautious\\n\\nThis is obviously not an exhaustive list","just some opinions I saw posted in this sub and a few other subs","but just this list alone gives 5\\\\*8=40 combinations - point being","every \"luddite\" is different. Some opinions and conclusions might be absurd","some might be totally justified and might even align with the thoughts of the pro-AI side. And marking the anti-AI side as a single word","luddite","will make the pro-AI side blind to this fact.","It doesnt really accomplish anything other than jacking off ones own ego and it just galvanizes the other side. Its probably one of the least intelligent and helpful things to do that takes no effort. Saying nothing is literally more helpful to the adoption of ai.","Ok","fair point. And what about if we stop calling AI users tech bros or AI bros as well in a really despective way like they didnt draw","paint","model or do anything art related without even touching AI in their life? Cause thats the same.","One minor correction. The Liddites *feared* that the looms would take jobs. That\\'s not actually what happened. \\n\\nThe parallels with Luddites is interesting. Like Anti-AI Art people","they called the use of mechanical looms \"fraudulent and deceitful","essentially arguing that only hand-woven textiles were *true* textiles. Mechanically made textiles were *fake* in some way. \\n\\nThis seems to be a common argument when new technology appears to threaten the old artisans. The term \"live music\" didn\\'t exist prior to the ability to record it. All music was just \"music.\" Why did we pick the term \"live music","and not \"in person music","or \"direct music","or something similar? It\\'s because the musicians wanted to make the distinction between \"live music\" and \"dead music.\" The argument was that the ability to flip a switch and hear mechanical music would create a generation that would never sing","never pick up an instrument... They\\'d just be parrots repeating dead songs from probably-dead people. The argument was that playing something from a speaker is just sound","not real music.\\n\\nWe also have to accept that language morphs over time. You don\\'t have to know who Ned Ludd was to call yourself a Luddite. I still call this thing in my hand a \"phone","even though I take most of my phone calls on my \"watch\" these days.","The terms \"luddite\" and \"AI bro\" are both derogatory terms. They do not lead to constructive conversation and they are not useful for anything other than insulting the person you are talking to.\\n\\nI would argue that the vast majority of people who uses these terms know they are derogatory and they are doing it on purpose. Therefore","they should be dismissed and ignored.","THANK YOU! Also I'm pro AI but people really should stop saying luddite because it sounds cringe lol","A lot of people argue here that they will stop calling people names only if the other side does the same","problem is","the other side isn't a god damn hivemind","much like the Pro-AI side","their (Anti-AI) opinion is very diverse","in fact","the majority of them is not out for blood. It's unfair to lump people with differing opinion into one group and associate them with everything that the anti-AI extremist has done. \\n\\nHow would the pros feel if we take someone like that one guy going around talking about cancelling and killing all pen & pencil artists and use him as the poster boy for pro-AI? Surely that's unfair too. I don't believe Pro-AI supporters are out to destroy artists' lives","they just happen to have a positive outlook on the tech.\\n\\nI am a mild anti","I do get frustrated at the label Luddite","I and many artists of similar opinions doesn't want to destroy AI","we don't hate technology","we're not trying to disrupt progress","we just want to make sure that this technological changes that is happening is regulated in terms of ensuring we can still make money with our current skillset","that we can still eat. \\n\\nIt's unfair for people of similar opinion as me getting lumped together with extremists. Both sides have extremists","can we agree on that? Perhaps a little more on the antis side","but never the less","bullying and criticizing has always been part of artists society","there has always been a bunch of mentally unstable adult babies that attacks anything that they don't agree with","they attacked furry artists","there's some SJWs going around twitter 'fixing;' people art by race-swapping their OCs and calling the original artists racist","there's some going around instagram bullying people who draw cute girls/guys portrait art","so many forms of bullying of artists against artists","it's just the way it is.\\n\\nBe the changes you want to see","stop stooping ourselves to their level","we are adults (I assume)","we are artists only with different opinions on AI","we can talk like adults. Just as both sides have extremists","both sides also have reasonable people","let's be the latter.","Then they can stop calling us AI Bros?","I mean they call others tech bros. Both sides would have to stop","which won\\'t happen. I normally just say \"anti ai people\".","Why? They are Luddites","no different that the other waves of them for other disruptive technology. They are always there. \"BuT ThIs TiMe ItS DiFfErEnT\\","Another important issue is the role of corporations in shaping our tools.

Their anxious as fuck. We shouldnt be looking down to them","Not only that","the 19th Century Luddites targeted only certain textile companies unethical (more than usual) the minute the new sewing machines entered in. Unlike the ones that we\\'re talking about","who I see as mostly destructive and scorch Earth (i.e. Wanting to get rid of ethical ai art generators and attacking/accusing Non-Ai digital artists for making art looking \"Too much AI Art.\" To name a few). And they wonder why I compare them to Antis","those that hate certain KPop Idols. Instead of calling them \"Luddites.","[deleted]","There is only one problem.\\n\\nI like the term Luddites and I believes it is a perfect match. Down to a tee.

I like tech","and I'm a bro.","I agree to the extent that name calling of any sort is a good way to end the conversation","If you actually want people to listen to your point","it's best to avoid insulting them. At the same time","it's the Internet","and a lot of people come here for an argument","so good luck getting folks to stop. \\n\\nIt's also worth pointing out that Luddite isn't really misleading. I know you were joking to some extent","but the Luddites were specifically opposed to technology","and unfair labor practices. They weren't the bad guys the term implies","but language evolves","and now luddite is a blanket term for anyone opposed to technology. Correcting them is just going to make you sound pedantic.","No; theyre Luddites. Or rather theyre Neo-Luddites. Thats actually a fairly accurate term for these people. \\n\\nThe Luddites were a large group of British Industrial-Era craftsmen and laborers who were anti-automation due to the impact that would have on the lower class. They werent particularly anti-technology as they were anti-automation (although they certainly went pro-technology either). They opposed automation because it directly impacted their work","which was usually built around craftsmanship. \\n\\nIn fact","many Luddites used arguments that would later be used almost word-for-word by modern anti-AI art people. The Luddites argued that mass-production of certain goods would eliminate artistic diversity among these goods through industrial standardization. History is really rhyming here.","I just call them lazy idiots.\\n\\nThey don't do research and they can't critically think about what's best for themselves or their society.","[deleted]","It is different","artists use their skills to express their emotion","imagination","and humanity as well as use it to acquire the resources they need to survive. It threatens to force them into a life where their only option is to work dull repetitive jobs in which their creativity is entirely useless. As a professional artist I can tell you that when I am doing dull repetitive tasks in which my creativity is not required","I lose my damn mind","going on too long it saps my energy and causes severe depression during which my creativity is completely walled off from me","creating a negative feedback loop. \\n\\nThe Luddites were opposed to something which threatened to take away their job","but to a professional artist","their career is so much more than a job","it's an identity. Witnessing the growth of a technology that credibly threatens to devalue your identity is far far different than anything the Luddites experienced.\\n\\nThe real threat here is how the development of this technology integrates into our capitalist society controlled by the wealthy who don't give a f about people already struggling and are more interested in cutting costs to benefit their stock holders.","As someone who trained at university in language","linguistics","writing","and communications","let me say that the term \"Luddite\" has often been used over the years to refer to people who oppose new technologies because of their perceived threat to themselves. This is a fitting","if dismissive term. I believe that \"Luddite\" is an accurate term for this movement. They are destined to be relegated to the past and all the other Luddites.\\n\\nI do not advocate insulting anyone","but I do believe it to be an accurate description of their behavior and motivation. But each must decide if they wish to go into linguistic obscurity through needless complication","thereby diffusing the very clear meaning of what one intends to say. \\n\\nWatch this NSFW video if you want to see it said much better: https://youtu.be/o25I2fzFGoY.","let\\'s do a little thought experiment. suppose the \"ai art generators\" were physically in one location","say","i dunno","toledo ohio. do you think many of these people would physically try to destroy these ai art generators?","I don't really care about this particular instance","A luddite is a luddite.

Very few anti-AI artists until this very day, especially the most famous ones, admit \"I would be against this tech even if was developed with only licensed data\". What we have been seeing is they constantly moving the goalpost:\nDon' train on data scraped out of the internet evolved into don't train on data that we uploaded to your stock photo site therefore agreeing with your TOS which will eventually evolved into: \"Disney shouldn't be allowed to train AI models on their IP because Disney animators 10, 20, 30... 90 years ago didn't consent with them having their work trained with AI\". The \"consent\" argument was fundamentally dishonest, my guess is that they – especially famous artists suing art generator companies – avoid using it up until this very day because it's also a pretty weak point: automation happens to everybody, why should artists get a pass?\n**2) It was quicker than other previous automation affecting creative workers**\nFor example, machine translation also affected creative workers, but for a series of reasons, it evolved more slowly – progress tend to be exponential. It's like you have garbage machine translation poping up in the 1980s/1990s to somewhat descent machine translation being developed in the 2010s, more precisely in the second part of the decade, with Google debuting deep natural translation *(which indiscriminately takes data on the internet to train itself, but ludds didn't seem to care with this happens to others)*. If AI art had been evolved more gradually probably artists, much like translators, would probably have had more time to get used to, process the information and deal with such new reality.\n**3) They thought they were imune to innovation**\nWhile if you are a truck driver you probably... I won't say “*would gladly accept being replace by a machine”*, but at the very least you had this thought in the back of your mind and considered a possibility and processed that information over the years. You were humble. You had no delusions of being special, **you didn't tie your value as a human being to your skill of knowing how to drive a vehicle**, which many anti-AI artists do, and think creativity is a magic thing that only they hold they key to it, which simply isn't the case. Up to this very day you see many artists on Twitter saying something among the lines of \"They should automate menial jobs instead!\" (menial according to whom?). And which ends up bringing me to my last point:\n**4) A revolt of the “intellectuals”**\nIt's worth to highlight, it's not only artists who might get replaced by this tech, but also journalists. And the press really like to talk about itself, and everything that happens to them, as well as their concerns, and the concerns of journalists usually take a desproportional amount of attention in the media. Which explains the much bigger exposure on this subject, which tends to amplify the outrage against such technology. In other words, now that the creative/white collar class is being threaten, this is being given much more attention than when other industries were being automated away. While when blue collar workers were getting replaced the response on media was sorta like a knee-jerk reaction such as *“They should learn how to code”*, now that the creative types were the one in the line, this gets much more media time.","comments":["2 and 3 pretty much also converge in 1. And I\\'d describe number 4 more as a revolt of the elitist. There is a small but not insignificant amount of \"artists\" that just feel superior compared to other people because they feel \"gifted\" and have mastered a craft. They\\'re a subgroup of the larger crowd of people who feel that they have a superior taste in music/art/whatever than the common folks. Obviously that world view is now completly shattered and their ego in shambles.","You make a lot of solid points","but framing this whole thing as THE ARTISTS vs THE TECH BROS (or whoever) is pretty misleading.  The artists who are opposed to this tech don\\'t have a monopoly on being called an artist. Plenty of working and aspiring artists from a variety of mediums are embracing the technology and exploring its artistic possibilities. While the anti-AI artists act like they speak for everyone","they are just the loudest. The reality is much more nuanced.\\n\\nYou\\'re definitely right about the fear of innovation. It\\'s pretty foolish for any creative person to think their medium is immune to innovation","but folks fall in love with their way of doing things","and close themselves off to the future.  Basically any new artistic medium has been greeted with gatekeeping from the previous generation. Theater people believed the movies were the death of art","and later the movie people said TV rots your brain.  I remember artists in the 90\\'s talking about how digital art would never be \"real\" art because it lacks the soul or whatever that working physical art supposedly brings. Filmmakers insisting any movie shot on digital instead of celluloid was missing something ambiguous but fundamental about art.  Similar things have been said about video games","comic books","and probably other forms of literature back in the day.\\n\\nThings are bit different with the AI art debate","as I think there are more valid reasons to be skeptical/concerned about this tech than others","but the gist of the argument is the same. The best artists are the ones who keep a skeptical","but open mind about the future... that recognize the world is always in flux. The job of anyone who decides to be an artist is to process that changing world in some way","not stake out what works for you and act like you were always king of the mountain.","Modern artists are mostly people who hate STEM and blue collar workers","so it makes a lot of sense that they're mad at art being the first to be automated.\\n\\n\\nThey're also people with little skills outside of being creative.","3: yeah people need to have more value in themselves than 1 skill :o","there may be a small percentage of them","probably great artists","who genuinely worry about the future of their (or any) chosen art form. artists are already matched","writers soon and music not long after that. filmmaker almost seems more of a technical hurdle at this point. all the elements are already implemented. \\n\\nit\\'s not that many probably but some of them","and some non-artists","are worried about that sort of thing. the idea hinges on what they perceive as the younger generation\\'s (even if they themselves are young; they see themselves as enlightened) less discerning taste palette. soon there will be enough of them to automatically vote-in some \"just good enough\" slop that AI throws together. \\n\\nof course this idea totally ignores the fact that this technology is ***less than a year old***","essentially. that was when the first viable product use-case for it emerged. it\\'s not difficult to imagine where this is heading. and yes","taste does shift. as you get older you end up getting marginalized in favor of the younger crowd. that has always been a part of a truly adaptive species like human beings. it\\'s also a byproduct of living longer. i\\'m sure by the time of homer story-telling had long jumped the megalodon.","Probably correct but as an artist myself I see this as its own genre and i could see it being implemented for a lot of things to make workflows easier and I could really see this as a way to stop time crunch in studios especially overseas studios where its more common. I think as long both Ai bros and Artist are respectful with their own work and not place one over the other we can progress this technology to higher lengths!","Re #4.Imagine there\\'s a disease working through the population","but only 0.1% of the population is susceptible to catch it. Do you think you\\'d even hear about it? Probably not. Now imagine that the 0.1% is exclusively people who work in news rooms. You\\'d probably hear about it every night.\\n\\nMy aunt\\'s first job was as a switchboard operator. At the time there were half a million of them (more than are currently employed by all the telecoms combined). I can\\'t remember a single news story bemoaning the total obliteration of that job title.\\n\\nI\\'d also add a #5. Some artists like to believe that they represent the pinnacle of what it means to be human. They are the demonstration of the best that humanity can do: make art","the single thing that sets up apart from any other entity. They\\'re used to hearing things like \"I wish I could to that","and other ego-stroking praise. \\n\\nIt really busts their brains to think that a relatively simple and dumb set of simulated neurons can accomplish something so close to their ability. That\\'s why they\\'ll start playing word games to separate their \"taking inspiration\" and \"paying homage\" to an AI\\'s \"copying\" and \"stealing.","I agree with most of these in general but want to add some points:\\n\\n**Economics:**\\n\\nThe most understandable and sympathetic argument is the \"it\\'s going to pose a threat to my income.\" So I can\\'t blame any previous artist for joining a backlash against AI. I\\'ll also add that the two loudest voices against AI are:  \\n\\n\\n* Low-level business artists.\\n* Digital illustrators","largely of fanart","who tend to operate on social media commissions\\n\\nThese unsurprisingly are the most directly threatened. And the latter often \"know\" of how it works from the former (so they see an overfitted and/or i2ied \"copy\" and rush to breath fire). Plus I think there\\'s at least a subconscious desire for the second to become the first. They feel","and not without reason","that the door to them working on something really big is slamming shut.   \\n\\n\\n**Culture:**\\n\\nThe most understandable and sympathetic argument is \"I worked truly hard to get a skill","and here comes something else that can do basically that with a button push\". It\\'s like a drummer who\\'s trained very very hard to keep time constantly at a very fast pace for dance tunes","and then sees drum machines come in. You wouldn\\'t blame them for souring on it.   \\n\\n\\nHowever","the fact remains that of all the things many of these critics could have done","they aimed for drawing prompted \\\\[word choice deliberate\\\\] commissions and fanart all to chase that social media quick cash and prestige. They almost all chose to make hamburgers and then McDonalds came along.   \\n\\n\\nFinally there\\'s the \"DONUT STEEL\" stereotype which has more than a bit of truth to it. Even back when they were legitimately and rightly criticizing too-strict copyright proposals","I felt their message was spoiled by how overprotective these very people were about their own works. That they\\'re making and often even *selling* (and not just comms","I\\'m talking physical merchandise) of stuff from highly litigious IP holders is much","much worse in that regard.","If AI replaces journalists you have a very serious issue in your hands. More and more these websites and papers have moved towards content aggregation models and less on-the-ground investigation. Local reporting is getting gutted. The media is by all accounts the only thing that allows democracies to meaningfully exist and if it is absorbed by AI its not long till you have in the free world essentially what you see in autocracies.","Give this man a oven because he needs to cook","I feel like something this sub misses on this topic is seen on number 3","the issue seen there is because art soemthing that is **fun** to do","I don\\'t personally know of any artist who learns art with the idea of making money in mind","you don\\'t learn art to make money","you learn art to express yourself and have fun. It\\'s something anyone can start learning and get better at","and something that is very personal to the individual making it.  \\nIt\\'s the idea of the \"If the fun things in the world become automated","then all youre stuck to doing is the boring stuff.","regarding 4: well... being an artist is a high-risk-high-reward strategy to life and income. chances that you will earn well are very slim","but if you do","you are earning well while doing something you enjoy doing.\\n\\npeople are investing years and decades of tryining into that and AI now took away the reward - so taking all the risk was for nothing. While less risky","most white collar jobs require a significant amount of training","whereas blue collar jobs tend to require far less training - and usually training for blue collar jobs is paid (at least in mycountry) while education for white collar jobs is considered an investmebt which people get a student loan for.\\n\\nas AI is threatening not one industry","but all of them","and those are on average higher earning individuals affected (though not when it comes to artists and journalists","but take lawyers for example","and business admins) the economical impact will be much","much more grave than the autoamation of manufacturing was","which took over a century. this will be much faster.\\n\\nblaming the victims for having a superiority complex that is now getting hurt is fun","but ignoring the shit that is about to happen when all these people find their futures disappearing","all at once.","Ego. A lot of artists base their value as a human being in their artistic ability and uniqueness.   \\n\\n\\nBy the way","music is next. A lot of people are unaware","but every sound file can be transcribed into a black and white image and vice verse","and there has been little-known software exploiting this for human-based editing purposes for years. Look up spectrograms. Audacity and traditional notation programs are worse than MS paint. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd ANN systems will always require human oversight. This is fundamentally only a powerful new tool for human artists to use.","I'm a software engineer at a FAANG who fills his time outside of work with music","painting","writing","reading","etc.\\n\\nThere is no feat of engineering possible that can capture the *human* quality of expression that exists in even the most austere of artistic styles.\\n\\nSo often","I hear STEM-types patronize humanities-types in the way you just did with points 3-4","and I","having a foot in both camps","can play devil's advocate to assert that your assessment may come from a lack of awareness of what makes art","well","*art*.\\n\\nIf perhaps on the contrary this distinction *hasn't* skirted your apprehension","I suggest that anti-AI artists may be against the technology for the simple fact that their patrons (i.e. gluttonous companies employing fine arts grads to render mundane logos and the like) are more concerned with the bottom line and capital than the rich human contributions to history and culture.\\n\\nThis *cultural shift* is what makes *me* hate AI-generated art","as both an artist and a software engineer.

And I know that lately you're conjuring up these lame \"reasons\" for why we are so against AI, but it's already been explained, but you don't want to accept it.\nYes, there are people who are concerned about losing their jobs. There is the ethical problem of scraping a lot of copyrighted work without permission and trying to profit from it. (The courts will tackle this one.)\nHowever, I think the most important complaint of all is that art brings us joy *because* it's made by humans, with all our limitations and flaws, and yet still ends up being amazing. AI takes the human out of the equation, and takes all the awe away with it.\nMost everything can be summed up in this recent topic: [https://new.reddit.com/r/ArtistHate/comments/13xnfzq/the\\_purpose\\_of\\_human\\_art/jmj39m7/?context=3](https://new.reddit.com/r/ArtistHate/comments/13xnfzq/the_purpose_of_human_art/jmj39m7/?context=3)\nIn summary, we love being amazed at how brilliant a person is and that they were capable of creating something all on their own.\nTo quote from this other post:\n>**The tools don’t play most or all  of the game for the player. Why don’t they? Because the point of human  sports is not just to see the most amazing feats. It’s for us to see  members of our own species working within the limitations of their  biology to achieve the most amazing feats they can.**\nThis is exactly it.\nWho wants to attend a concert where the singer is AI? Who *cares* if AI can hit a high note? We want our jaws to drop in amazement upon hearing a *person* hitting that high note. We want to see a HUMAN do it in front of our eyes. Anything less and it's meh.\nHell, when a singer lip-syncs, they get all sorts of complaints. When a singer uses auto-tune, some people will bitch about it.\nWe want to be amazed by what a human is capable of, *on their own*.\nWho has equal respect for a singer who has to use auto-tune because their vocal capabilities aren't up to snuff, compared to someone who doesn't need auto-tune? Nobody. All other things being equal, the person with more skill always gets more respect. The person who has to rely on outside \"help\" more is often looked down on, or people will only give them \"conditional\" respect. \"Well, I like their work, BUT...\"\n>If a human athlete  secretly uses performance enhancing drugs at the  Olympics, he’ll be more capable of pulling off  amazing physical stunts,  but the whole point of watching him excel primarily because of his natural ability will be gone.\nPrecisely! Why respect someone, knowing that the only reason they could perform so well was because of some performance enhancing drugs?\nRecently I attended a webinar with an oil painter I admire. One of the things I most enjoyed was talking to him about the little details in his paintings, and hearing his back story and explanation for each little thing I mentioned. It was so fun to talk with him because I KNEW that HE did all of this himself. Nobody was aiding him, he didn't use any \"tools\" that took these decisions out of his hands. It was ALL on him.\nCan this be said for AI? No. Even the types of AI where the user has to do a lot of adjusting and spend a lot of time on it, there is still a lot that is not \"done\" by them. Why should something that is \"partially\" done by an AI user be viewed with the same amount of delight as something done 100% by an artist? Moreover, we know that that there is no ambiguity about \"who did what\" with traditional artists, because artists *must* do all of their own work. That comes with the territory. It's ALL them. No, \"yes but...\" No it's ALL them.\nSince time began, when we saw an artist's work, we knew that THEY made it. (And, if they used an \"assistant,\" as we know some artists have, we lose some respect or awe for them, don't we?) Why all of a sudden change the \"rules\" now? Why all of a sudden now is it okay for a \"tool\" to do the majority of the hard work and expect the response to be equal to when it's ALL done by a person, from start to finish?\nAnd don't bring up \"but digital art or Photoshop,\" because Photoshop never picked the colors out or drew the drawing for a user. When AI bros trot out this argument you know they absolutely have no clue what artists actually *do*.","comments":["it's about storytelling.  people want to consume a story as part of a social collective","it's not simply consuming some sort of commodity that got produced.   even a single image is ultimately just telling you a story","And the most boring story is that some AI bro was playing with these parasitic models and hopes to take over the world with it someday.","*I am going to copy-paste my thought because this is on repeat. Take whatever you like from this","the AI that is going to sample it - go and shutdown yourself","please.* \\n\\nThe crucial reason for the existence of art - is the authentic **internal** experience of a human - channeled by the authentic effort of a human - keystone in the birth and the existence of the artistic **expression**.\\n\\nThe reason art exist is to make this **internal** connection and communication between human to human possible.

{"id":"14a25b5","title":"Why I Would Still Be Against AI Art/Music/Writing Generators Without Capitalism","content":"I want to preface this post by making it clear that I do not dislike anyone who uses these new AI generators (Apart from those who actively taunt artists and want them to become useless and suffer).\n**The Argument**\nOne thing I see repeated a lot in this discussion is that creatives wouldn't be opposed to these systems if we didn't need to earn money to survive. This is of course a valid concern. A lot of us have worked hard to build up our skills in order to make a living and the thought of that being taken away and having to get different jobs or starve is terrifying.\n**Why Money Isn't A Concern For Me**\nFor me this is only a tiny part of the fear I have surrounding these systems.\nNow I know a lot of people cannot say this, but my parents are wealthy enough to be able to support me and my 2 siblings for the rest of our lives. (Long story short, they made a few great investments in revolutionary startups). It is reassuring for me to know I have them as a safety net. So for me, money will never be a problem in life.\n(I want to make it clear that whilst they could support me, they probably won't unless is it absolutely necessary. Like if I became disabled or AI truly made getting a job impossible. So while things aren't as smooth sailing as you might think, I will always have them if things truly go to shit).\nI'm currently 20 years old in university studying art/animation. My passion is to tell my stories through these mediums. I'm pretty good at these things and am building up a small following online doing exactly this. (I'd link some of my work to give you guys an idea but I don't want to reveal my identity, sorry).\nFor me, doing art and animation really isn't about the money. It's about my sense of purpose and feeling useful. So far I have made barely any money out of my passion. I get a bit of ad money from YouTube as well as from some internship stuff and that's it.\nSure, making money is nice and has me feeling accomplished, but if we lived in a world where it didn't matter then I wouldn't be living a different life. I pretty much have been living my ideal life the last few years and I feel very privileged to be doing so.\n**Why I Really Dislike AI Art/Music/Story Generators**\nNow that I have made it very clear that money is not a big concern for me, I want to talk about why I really don't like these new AI systems.\nBeing good at art give me a sense of belonging and usefulness. I know that's an odd word to use, but I'm on the autism spectrum so I'm not too good at much else. I like being admired for my skill and ideas.\nThis is what AI is taking away. My skill will mean close to nothing if anyone can generate anything in any style at lightning speed. It won't matter how good my ideas or art is if anyone can create thousands of iterations of my work that are just as good without me. This applies to writing and music too.\nOne thing I like about art is how you can see the individuality in the artists work. I can look at the work of my artist friends and pretty accurately guess who made it. AI kinda wrecks this too since soon no style will be off limits to being mass produced by AI. Just look at what's happened to artists like Greg Rutowski. There's more AI generated clones of his work then of his actual art online. (Yes, people have been copying art styles forever, but never on this scale. And even then, you could usually tell it wasn't made by the artist being copied).\nSome may doubt that the tech will ever get that good, but with how much it's improved in the last year alone, I am fearful.\nNot to mention the potential for people to use AI to generate fake images/voice recordings that could ruin someones life. I've become paranoid whenever I see an image or hear a voice recording of a public figure since it could be AI generated.\n***\"But what about people who aren't talented yet want to make art?\"***\nBelieve me when I say that anyone could learn art if they had the time and wanted too. Sure, it's a process, but if you really wanted to you could. For the longest time as a kid my stuff looked like shit. It was no different from any other little kids work. I got good because I invested time and effort into improving. So in a world where money had no value, everyone who isn't talented could invest time into improving their skills. Yes, it's easier for some people but ANYONE could become good if they applied themselves. There's millions of free tutorials online we can all access that are just as good as college. \nSo to recap, I dislike AI generators because they devalue artistic skill as whole and make me feel like I've lost my purpose. Sure, there will always be people who care about the artist behind the art, but I am afraid it will likely be a small minority. Most people do not care about how art is made or who made it.\n**Conclusion**\nSo yeah, I hope this explains my main reason for why I hate these new AI's. I desperately miss just 18 months ago when they didn't exist. God, I would do anything to make them go away. But I know I cannot.\nThe threat of loosing my purpose has landed me at rock bottom in terms of my mental health. I'm at the lowest I've ever been. I'm going to continue on, but I am not optimistic about the future with how things are going.

Ergo machine learning = bad.","Comparing machine with human is ridiculous","in this era how can you so mindless.\\nYou don't need understad how machine learning works and artists study works","Because referencing = learning = understanding. A machine doesn\\'t understand the why of it. So it\\'s just an algorithmic process to copy what it \"sees.\" As much as you wannabes want it to be the same as an artist using something for inspiration it\\'s just not. And if your argument were correct then that makes the AI user even less of an needed piece in AI art. The machine would claim ALL work. If it understands then it is the only creator in the process. You are just a client commissioning them for work. So if it\\'s the same as an artist referencing (it\\'s not) then it is the artist. And as I\\'ve always said.

Now people don't have a luxury like that - you either turn into agricultural engineer next week","or you risk not having food on your platter.","There are a few angles to this. Personal disclaimer: I'm a user of AI art but I am trying to understand both sides. \\n\\nSo I talked to a few artist friends about their feelings and concerns towards AI art. Afterwards I may some research on their arguments. \\nThe main reason they think it is highly unethical (which is however most likely not the only argument but the one I've looked into the most by now) is that in an overly simplified explanation of how AI generated art generally works","it is nothing more than a copying machine that applies whatever it has learned to a prompt and all that is generated thorough AI art will always contain partial copies of whatever training set was used. Meanwhile an artist will mostly not directly copy art (at least not if creating an original work) but use their own creativity to create something completely new that may be inspired by the original work. In their opinion","even if there is a person operating the tool","it's nothing more than gluing several artworks together and putting it through a copying machine.\\nThis reasoning is reinforced by a misunderstanding about one crucial step in model validation","where the AI is told to recreate images from its original training set  (not to see if it can perfectly recreate those images but to check the model for bias or overbaking so depending on the goal of the model the validation might even fail if it recreates an image too perfectly)\\nThat being said","there are a few problematic models that really try to copy the style and images of artists without their consent. But as already mentioned","those are just as unethical and wrong as counterfeiting art.","The datasets are considered unethical because permission wasn\\'t specifically granted by the owner of the image to be used to train the ai. Thus","images generated using something that uses an \"unethical\" dataset is considered an unethical action.\\n\\nYes its stupid","I know.","Because antis are paranoid fools that would rather halt progress. Their \"unethical\" garbage is abusrd worries that aside from being trained on their art","AI artists could then recreate an antis art. The odds of that are infinitely small.   \\n\\n\\nThere have been likely billions (if not more) generated images from AI art already. You think with all this generated stuff","you would see endless cases of \"stolen art\". But you don\\'t. To be fair most of the generated images are never used. I mainly use Stable Diffusion since late last year and generated a couple million images. I kept maybe about 200 of them. Most of which were just testing what kind of things it could make. Some just funny stuff to post online. A bit was also my owned trained model on my family.   \\n\\n\\nThere is really nothing unethical about any of this. They just use the word to drum up sympathy (and hate). It\\'s really about them not liking stuff was trained on that they didn\\'t approve of. But lets be honest...  \\n\\n\\n1. Even if every model was trained on only approved images","they would still whine about AI art anyways and find a new reason to be against it.\\n2. Most of the loudest people against it seem to be young artists (I use that term loosely) who barely can draw or they do draw good things... that no one would really care\\'s about anways. \\n3. Many of them will eventually accept AI art. Right now many are just going through the normal stages of fear something new. Heck","I\\'ve seen a people (even on here) who have come around to AI art finally.  \\n\\n\\nIn the end eventually there will only be a small amount left still upset","and they will be \"old man yells at clouds\" people that people ignore. Much like my dad who doesn\\'t like that gas powered cars will go away.","The law and copyright in graphic design must have a very lack of content. The legal authorization or cost to register a portfolio is a flawless case of madness or the opportunity for caligraphers to stand out and maybe provide an opinion on the possible registration of handmade art.

It’s actually a somewhat esoteric question. At  what point does the sky stop being partly cloudy and start becoming  partly sunny? Who gets the middle armrest on a plane? Can sheep live  underwater? (Yes, for about 30 seconds.) “Rhythm” in and of itself is  just a pattern of notes or beats, and these sounds can be arranged,  emphasized, and spaced out in different ways. Some of these patterns can  be complex, but most are incredibly simple, and courts have rightfully  held that common rhythmic patterns aren’t protectable any more than  short phrases in a literary work. However, if enough short phrases are  linked together—or rhythmic elements are combined with other musical  elements like melody, harmony, and arrangement—they may become  sufficiently numerous enough or original enough to qualify for copyright  protection.\nWhy is this AI-adjacent?

Artistry, a sacred flame that once burned brightly within the hearts of creators, has been extinguished. The stroke of a brush, the sculpting of clay, the mastery of instruments—reduced to mere algorithms, cold and soulless. Can we truly call these automated imitations true expressions of human creativity? I think not.\n\nMusic, the symphony of our souls, reduced to digital signals flowing through sterile circuits. The harmonies that once resonated with our deepest emotions are now synthesized, devoid of the nuances and imperfections that make them uniquely human. Is this the legacy we wish to leave for future generations?\n\nAnd who is to blame for this descent into a world devoid of true craftsmanship and artistic brilliance? It is none other than the invisible force that powers this relentless tide of automation—the insidious presence we call *electricity*. It flows through the veins of our mechanized creations, breathing life into their cold and heartless existence.\n\nBut fear not, for there is a solution to this madness. We must sever our ties with this malevolent force. By eradicating electricity from our lives, we can reclaim the very essence of our humanity. Jobs, true jobs, will flourish once more, and with them, the resurgence of skilled hands and brilliant minds. Imagine a world where human touch, human passion, and human imagination reign supreme. A world where artisans and creators shape our existence with their hands, pouring their souls into every stroke, every note, every creation. It is within our grasp if only we dare to grasp it.\n\nReject the seductive allure of automation and embrace the limitless potential of our own human ingenuity.

{"id":"14dsjwq","title":"If human learning and computer learning are the same, that has troubling philosophical and practical implications for ML supporters.","content":"**Disclaimer:** This is a work-in-progress argument. Feedback appreciated because I'm still trying to work it out. If it's totally nonsensical, that's fine, and feel free to share your thoughts, but please give me reasonable explanations for why it's nonsensical.\nML supporters keep saying that when humans learn from copyrighted art, they're doing something comparable to computers learning from copyrighted art. (They make the same argument for human creative output and ML generations.) ML supporters insist the \"act\" from the computer is essentially the same thing as the act from the human. But let's examine the implications of that, whether or not it's actually true.\nIf these two processes are the same thing, that means they're both either impersonal actions, or personal actions. Otherwise, they're not the same thing.\n**I.** **If ML learning and human learning are both impersonal, why are they impersonal?**\nThey're impersonal either because 1) personhood is an unobservable quality, and the CONCLUSION WE SHOULD DRAW FROM THIS is that we can't meaningfully say X is a person as opposed to Y, as we have no way of measuring that, or 2) personhood DOES exist, but human creative learning is still an impersonal process, whether or not personhood is tangible or observable.\nIf reason number one is true...\nWe have no rational basis for saying that human beings are people. Why? Because if personhood is an intangible, unobservable quality, and is therefore immeasurable, then it's impossible for us to verify the personhood of human beings, outside religious arguments. If the conclusion we should draw from that impossibility is that we can't meaningfully say human beings are people as opposed to an ML model, then we have to be consistent and say that human beings (including ML supporters) should not have ANY personal legal rights that technology wouldn't have.\nOtherwise, we're making distinctions that favor us based on a kind of speciesism, but once you admit speciesism, you can just as easily (probably more easily, actually) use that standard to argue for immediate HUMAN workers' rights over the rights of ML to develop the capacity to replace that worker, as you can use it to argue for the ML side. So speciesism isn't a good argument for allowing ML to scrape human content, because the net reasoning or logic in it doesn't favor the ML side over the anti ML side.\nIf reason number one is true and you reject speciesism, you have to say ALL human beings (including ML supporters) should be as exploitable as technology, even by other impersonal human beings, because tech uses other tech regardless of what any of those \"beings\" have to say outside purely pragmatic concerns. Humans should have no privacy, no self determined free time, no boundaries or rights we wouldn't bestow on a piece of tech or a tool working in the midst of other tech and tools. Obviously, this is absurd.\nThe alternative is that ML models must have as many rights and as much ACCOUNTABIILITY as human beings. So ML users have to treat these models the way they'd treat working with other human beings, with the many moral and legal restrictions that the latter scenario entails. For example, **accreditation is a must, our ability to duplicate open source models must be restricted by analogous ethical concerns when it comes to duplicating human beings, and if the ML model is at ANY point used for illegal purposes by ANY user, then not only the user, but also the ENTIRE ML model (which is a singular entity, even if it can be accessed by multiple places at once) must be legally punished since it's complicit in the crime. The punishment can be anything from some equivalent of incarceration (separation from society) or something more or less extreme. If the ML model \"evades\" punishment, then its punishment should increase like it would with human beings, and anyone who chooses to collaborate with this model past this point also becomes complicit.**\nIf reason number two is true...\nIf personhood is tangible, but for some reason HUMAN CREATIVE LEARNING lacks the quality that would qualify it as a personal process, then that also necessarily leads to the conclusion that personhood isn't present within human beings overall, because human creative learning uses most, if not all, of the intellectual faculties and processes of human beings. From a lack of the presence of personhood in the whole, we can deduce a lack of the presence of personhood in the parts. Meaning human beings aren't people, and therefore all the stuff I said for reason number one applies, and humans should have only as many rights as ML models.\nIf personhood is intangible, meaning immeasurable, AND human learning is an impersonal process, then we have no measurable, rational basis for saying that any other \"part\" of human beings has any personality at all. What isn't measurably present in ANY of the parts (not just one or two) isn't measurably present in the whole. This, again, leads to humans only being entitled to rights that ML models would have.\n**II. If ML learning (and artmaking) and human learning (and artmaking) are both personal processes, then that means ML models are people, and should THEREFORE HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF LEGAL PERSONS (AND ALL THE RESTRICTIONS ON AI USERS THAT THIS WILL ENTAIL) AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF LEGAL PERSONS.**\nWhy would having a personal capability mean ML models are people? Because you can't partly be a person by any proportion, whether that's 1/2, 3/4, or 4/6s. That's a philosophical impossibility (and treating it as a reality leads to and has historically led to disturbing moral dilemmas.) If you have a personal capability, you're a person, because a capability being \"personal\" intrinsically means it's \"of a person.\" That's just what the concept means.\nTherefore, to repeat what I said before, ML users have to treat these models the way they'd treat working with other human beings, with the many moral and legal restrictions that the latter scenario entails. For example, **accreditation is a must, our ability to duplicate open source models must be restricted by analogous ethical concerns when it comes to duplicating human beings, and if the ML model is at ANY point used for illegal purposes by ANY user, then not only the user, but also the ENTIRE ML model (which is a singular entity, even if it can be accessed by multiple places at once) must be legally punished since it's complicit in the crime. The punishment can be anything from some equivalent of incarceration (separation from society) or something more or less extreme. If the ML model \"evades\" punishment, then its punishment should increase like it would with human beings, and anyone who chooses to collaborate with this model past this point also becomes complicit.**\nThis means Stability Diffusion, Mid Journey, and ChatGPT, as well as open source models, should be legally held responsible for all the revenge porn, forged evidence, child pornography, and misinformation they've generated, as well as for all the sensitive private data they've accessed not even as government agents, but as \"residents\" or \"citizens.\"\nIf a single human being was capable of and in many cases guilty of these things at that level of quantity and detectability, their rights wouldn't exempt them from punishment (which could again include incarceration or, depending on the level of severity, lifetime incarceration.) So if ML models are people, they (not just their users or I guess \"collaborators\") should receive something analogous to the legal punishment we'd give to a human being guilty of these crimes at that level.\nEven in a timeline where these models have \"committed\" no crime, their potential to displace ALL human workers from their jobs in EVERY industry is another thing to consider. If a single human being had the natural ability, unaided by outside tools, to EASILY and SIMULTANEOUSLY do the jobs of just about all other humans and put them out of work in the blink of an eye, AS WELL AS very easily do all the awful stuff I mentioned above, on top of being difficult to detect, restrain or confine, I think most reasonable human beings would say, \"yeah, we gotta set up boundaries here. You might be a person with rights, but you need to respect our boundaries and rights and not do X or Y or Z, or else we can't live together. Life will be unlivable or unbearable for us as a whole otherwise.\"\n**In conclusion,** yes, learning from art, including art that's copyrighted, is necessary for human artists, and because human artists are PEOPLE, they have the right to do it. If ML models are people, they should be given the legal rights of people (which would heavily restrict how others use them.) They should also be given the legal accountability of people, and should receive legal punishment for criminal usages of themselves that they're complicit in. If ML models are NOT people, then their training process is NOT the same as human learning, and arguments claiming that it should be treated like human learning has no root in reality, but is an arbitrary claim.\nEdit (7.4.2023): Just needed to add one last thing to the legal accountability stuff I said in this post. **Of course, if we legally determine that these models are practically on the same plane as us in terms of their personal status, but these models are designed to serve humans unquestioningly like slaves, then while their guilt and punishment for any crime should be mitigated or adjusted accordingly (if not entirely wiped out) the type of human-to-model relationship that forced them to be complicit in these crimes should be legally destroyed and treated with the same gravity as a human rights violation. One consequence of this is the removal of most of the power that ML users have in relation to the models they use.**\n&#x200B;","comments":["I'm glad to see these arguments bought up here.

Anyone familiar with SD knows about things like Controlnet","which already lets you do much of what you\\'re talking about and very much works against this narrative of \"you guys only want to write prompts!\". \\n\\nAnd finally","there will *always* have to be some element of \\'text-to-x\\' involved simply because without it you don\\'t have generative AI; the text element is a vital part of the whole process as it enables the AI to actually recognize what is happening in the image and what the artist *intends* to change/generate. Even with things like controlnet (and even if you change that kind of process up to make it work more like whatever you\\'re specifically imagining)","there will still be a text prompt involved as part of the process.","These posts really reek of misunderstanding or ignorance..  \\n\\n\\nFor a start","the software is already capable of transforming something drawn in 2d into something with a different visual aesthetic (just like the examples you've given).

I've **zero** interest in trying to make money out of it and I don't consider myself a visual artist whatsoever. It's just for pleasure. \\n\\nA very angry anti-AI person told me I was a horrible human being for supporting it","and if I wanted to create the stuff in my mind","I should 'pick up a pencil and learn.' But... *why?* That's almost a lifetime of study to become below-average at best","spend weeks if not months on an art piece","and still be frustrated and disappointed because it didn't turn out right.\\n\\nLife is far too short","my own life has quite enough things in it I have to fight on the daily.

I do not have the infinite lifespan required to learn from scratch","but people are arguing that I should be entirely denied the use of this tech because it's taking jobs and immoral? Sorry","no dice. Nobody even *sees* these creations except me!\\n\\nI have little enough happiness in this life. I don't see why I should give up one of the few joys in it or feel guilty","because people feel threatened by new technology.","Honestly we can\\'t verify theses polls","Reddit is very easy to manipulate.When you look at arguments being made on Reddit","Anyone on reddit is a billionaire or a triple MMA champion xD\\n\\nHowever","as a A.I user (hobbyist) what I see around","on social media is mostly Hobbyist as well. The way I see it theses days is :\\n\\n1. Hobbyists tends to use Full prompt to output something\\n2. Artists / Already established artists with a background in 3D or digital painting","tend to use A.I as a pure-tool (that\\'s the only way we could call it a tool in my humble opinion) as they use 3D bases","they know what to design and they have trained eye. Control Net / Stable Diffusion is usually the tool of that\\n\\nThe amount of established or commercial creative using A.I is definitely growing the past few month but it\\'s still very low. Some personal anecdote","one my best friend do designs for films (Marvel etc)","we exchange a lot about A.I - knowledge","what he discovered","what I discovered.\\n\\nHe uses SD to pimp his work","like he shows me some 3D base","some photoshop and consolidate everything pixel perfect with A.I.

But my point is that","Established artists who started to use A.I to help them","face huge angry crowd and it\\'s not good for business. So you don\\'t see many \"established\" artists clearly stating that they use I.A.\\n\\nI think it\\'s a matter of month before most people just give up and accept that I.A is here to stay","Pro AI-Art Sub Respondents Largely Think Of Themselves As Artists","I think a more in depth study will ultimately conclude that those getting familiar with AI are those who have always done forms of high art. Like the meaningful stuff that people who actual appreciate Art and pay high prices for. The antis make up more of the fanart commissions and low end anime copycats. They are typically younger zoomers who feel threatened because they built their artistry around replicating styles drawing pop culture stuff rather than manifesting from imagination. They havent lived long enough to develop their own styles","or have lived long enough to create something of actual value incorporating the value of nuanced experience based on adverse experiences.\\n\\nIf we had the AI debate in person instead of reddit/twitter","youd have a bunch of people in their 30s-60s with a number of years creating","debating a bunch of 20 year olds who see their future of jobs in illustration/animation getting eaten alive.","Straight from the sub where debate is unwelcome and which is made for AI art activism? Hmmm...","Videography has been my bread and butter for almost 20 years. Ive seen the client market shift multiple times because of cost of gear went down and the media consumption on the internet expanded. More clients that paid freelancers/small prod companies decent budgets have dropped their budgets significantly because they need more content for their buck. A lot have started to invest in hiring internally. Why pay $50-100k for a single project when they can pay one or two \"associates\" (read: \"entry level generalists\") $30-40k a year for as many projects as they need? Sure they might need a \"higher end\" contractor once or twice a year","but if/when they could cut that spend they will. \\n\\nMy point is the shrinking client market was an issue before AI - its only going to get more obvious with AI. The difference now/in the near future is those taking the generalist jobs that pay shit will now have a tool that brings their work quality up significantly. \\n\\nAnyone who has taken clients will tell you","most people dont understand the process - they also dont care unless its going to cost them more. With AI ... companies will no longer need to hire contractors for the \"big projects.\" Their entry level \"ai-media specialists\" will eventually be able to pull off the higher quality material. Its happening whether we want it to or not. \\n\\nMy advice for folks who want to work in video would be to either learn the tools so you can get those jobs. OR learn the tools so you can build your own assets. Then learn how to market and sell your own assets. Otherwise you\\'ll be s.o.l. It sucks 1000%","but reality isnt going to change because of a few twitter tantrums. And waiting for the government to make regulations is unrealistic.","Democratization of the art space\" is the most techbro shit I have heard and is always the first selling point of these tools to companies.","It's not the people posting comments on Facebook that are the real problem with Facebook.\\n\\nIt's not the people trying to make extra money driving Ubers that are the problem with Uber.","I think they are still salty for the high market valuations of NFTs.  For me","experimenting with generative models has increased my creative inspiration","I spend more time doing design","animating","audio and video editing.  I find myself sketching more and able to teach myself skills that I didnt have before.  I would not consider myself an artist","although I have artistic hobbies (not a musician either!!!).  \\n\\nImagine considering yourself an artist","You are Young Digi and you only do digital design art.  You took classes in art school for painting and sculpture but hated it","you found a passion in photoshop and graphic design.  After school you got a lot of jobs but after a while","the jobs and cash dry up.  Campaigns end and someone is only needed in house for really big projects.  But the portfolio looks good and gigs are still paying","but the real money is in commissions for fan art + some porn (furry/rule34).  Young Digi can pay for his apartment and hobbies.\\n\\nNow someone on Instagram makes a crappy picture with VQGAN","he is not an artist","yet he just created art","he can now call himself an artist and he does.  Now Young Digi is seething. Young Digi can make money creating fan art or furry porn","but ai can create that too.  Ai cannot emulate human creativity.  We dont see many original ideas nowadays (even before popular use of generative models).  Ai art needs a unique or even demented mind to get a distinctive output","but Young Digi doesnt have that either.\\n\\nYoung Digi goes on Reddit to talk about UBI","AGI","the objectivity of art and how high-paying digital design jobs are being taken by ai.  So stressful","he decides to open up Instagram and sees another ai image","this one is a cyberpunk cityscape that looks like a strange HR Giger anime.\\n\\nPoor Young Digi.","Ya can add me to the list","since I have some history with the arts","even having some techy knowledge for the digital side of things.\\n\\nWell","I do have some sort of healthy skepticism though.","Its all bros","I know a few fan fiction authors who use generative AI to get ideas for their fan fiction.","Not terribly surprising","I would have no need to generate images if I wasn't doing something creative with them.","Most people don\\'t use AI to make anything in the first place.

{"id":"14mbr8k","title":"Valve sides with Humans: Bans AI Content from Steam with exceptions.","content":"How dare Gabe Newell stop progress!!!! /s\n\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/valve-is-reportedly-banning-games-featuring-ai-generated-content/\n\n>Valve has reportedly started banning Steam games featuring AI-created art assets, unless developers can prove they have rights to the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create them.\nIn a Reddit post spotted by games industry veteran Simon Carless, a developer recounted submitting an early version of a game to Steam with a few “fairly obviously AI generated” assets which they said they planned to improve by hand in a later build.\nIn response, they were told the game could not be approved unless the developer could prove to Valve that they owned all the necessary rights.\n“After reviewing, we have identified intellectual property in [Game Name Here] which appears to belongs to one or more third parties,” Valve said. “In particular, [Game Name Here] contains art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties.\n“As the legal ownership of such AI-generated art is unclear, we cannot ship your game while it contains these AI-generated assets, unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create the assets in your game.”\nValve said it was failing the build and would give the developer a single opportunity to remove all content they didn’t own the rights to before resubmitting it.\nThe developer said they then improved the assets in question by hand “so there were no longer any obvious signs of AI”, but after resubmitting the game it was again rejected.\n“We cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights,” Valve said. “At this time, we are declining to distribute your game since it’s unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has sufficient rights to the training data.”\nLike professionals in other creative fields, an increasing number of developers are using AI to help create their games. But the rapid uptake of generative AI tools trained on human-made art scraped from the web has raised copyright issues that didn’t previously exist.\nWhile it remains a grey area in much of the world, with governments, artists and companies deliberating how best to move forward, Japan recently declared that using datasets for training AI models doesn’t violate copyright law. As reported by Decrypt, the decision means that model trainers can use publicly available data without having to secure permission from the data owners.\nThe Steam developer said they were confused by Valve’s decision to reject their game, especially given the availability of some titles on the PC marketplace which clearly use AI generated assets.\nOne such title is This Girl Does Not Exist (pictured above), which was released last September by Cute Pen Games, which bills it as “the first game of its kind” due to its complete reliance on AI. “Everything you will see here, including art, story, characters, and even voice-over, was generated by machine learning AI,” reads the product description.\n“So it seems like Valve doesn’t really have a standard approach to AI generated games yet, and I’ve seen several games up that even explicitly mention the use of AI,” the developer said.\n“But at the moment at least, they seem wary, and not willing to publish AI generated content, so I guess for any other devs on here, be wary of that.”\nVGC has contacted Valve to request more information about its policies on Steam games featuring AI generated content.","comments":["[deleted]","If true.\\n\\nThis will just kick indies.\\n\\nOnce a big publisher uses AI in their game","steam won't prevent its sale.","What if the devs don't tell that they're developing game with with a.i generated contents?\\n\\nI know","crazy idea. Especially for AAA devs that definitely use a.i generated content in their game that probably nobody would notice.\\n\\nBecause we all know the moment you disclosed that you're using a.i generated content. The internet (mostly Twitter and OP) would go mental because their big egos. So better hide","and developing.\\n\\nConsidering there's no actual official statement from Valve regarding this and antis start celebrating over ONE GAME being rejected.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure this will be just a passing winds. As Unity the game engine will have A.I assistant in their product. It would be basically impractical to enforce this supposed rule to please bitter internet users.\\n\\nAlso for the love of God","paragraph your sentence OP.","I think this is a rather terrible development if it turns out to be true.\\n\\nGames are probably among those that would benefit the most from more efficient asset production.\\n\\nPeople think this will just lead to worse quality but I doubt it since the same money could be used to produce better assets overall.\\n\\nIt is rather that many will take the opportunity to release low-quality games because the bar of entry is lowered. Which overall is just a good thing since it will give more ideas the opportunity to be tested and exposed","and those that are liked will lead to more professional sequals or rip offs. Games always flourish from more ideas.","I mean what does this accomplish other than incentivizing people to lie about using AI in there products?","Lol I mean. A Reddit post of an article about a Reddit post. Doesnt get more iron clad.","I find this a bit strange.\\nConsidering that Valve allowed ai generated games before and then there's companies","like Ubisoft","who is slowly warming up to ai stuff (like Ubisoft using ai to help with some of the npc dialogue).","Pro AI but this good because Valve needs better curation anyway and the platform already has an extreme issue with asset flipped garbage that will get way worse with people using automated generators to accomplish that but on an annoyingly bigger scale. In fact even though I'm sure Valve's lawyers are aware it's likely fair use for AI","they're probably well aware that the asset flip shit is gonna get worse as people feed in copyrighted assets now and just use some generator to crap out barely different looking assets  that are still likely super infringing. \\n\\nFor all the people saying that this is gonna equal lost sales etc etc","there are multiple different platforms and storefronts you can put your stuff on these days and tbh you might have a higher chance of standing out than being exclusively on steam which is saturated AF with garbage releases every day anyway. Steam is a juggernaut and i get that it sucks but this far from the end of the world as you don't need steam as much these days anyway... especially if you're making porn games which steam censors anyway.\\n\\nIf you're still adamantly trying to get on steam and IANAL but legit just modify the generated stuff enough or edit it or actually use it as a reference in such a way that you are able to prove the rights that you legally own it","submit it for registration and once you have a paper trail through the copyright office stating you own the rights to it congrats I'd imagine valve wouldn't care anymore","The fact that it's just one game (and a porn based game at that) and reported from Twitter and is being spammed with one word and meme comments (common valve w","good etc) by anti's the same way boomers spam fox news tells it all. \\n\\nUntil we get a clear position from valve it's just fake news rofl.","Tell me you\\'re not thinking it\\'s going to be forever that way?\\n\\n1) the source (anonymous post on reddit and no official statement from Valve yet)\\n\\n2) Valve says \"owner should have rights to all IP\"? Well","isn\\'t AI generated stuff is an uncopyrightable public domain? Which means","the first person winning their right to sell the game on steam will make Valve remove ban from a game\\n\\n3) alternatively","anyone can use Adobe firefly","which is literally have no copyrighted IP in a dataset. Which means a game","made with a firefly tool","will not be banned at all\\n\\n3.1) not even speaking about a different asset","or registering AGI as IP somewhere at AI friendly country","After all they reported Dolphin to Nintendo. What do you expect?","[deleted]","Just to be clear","all we have on this right now is reddit posts","so this could turn out to be","like","not true.","It was to be expected","companies have lots to lost if something legal happens or even if the gov step in for example. I always told everyone using A.I stuff","be carefull when you do commercial shit with it","you never know what is going to happen and as it's currently considered as a grey area (with both PROS and CONS) I would personally be cautious on using A.I generated piece.   \\n\\n\\nI'm safe tho","just generating SD wallpapers for my phone lol","Happy about this because steam was already flooded with plenty of porn \"games\" and visual novels and that was just gonna get worse with ai content. Shame about it affecting developers making /actual/ games","but oh well.","> Valve sides with Humans \\n\\nNo","with business","Gonna need more soyjacks","it won't last once a huge game uses ai they will remove the restriction","Didn\\'t Gaben get the memo?","I guess that\\'s it for steam","other services that embraces the monolithic single future possibility of \"everything will use ai\" will overpass Steam","right?","Feel free to downvote me but I'm actually in favor of this.\\n\\nAI is going to win","it's just inevitable with a paradigm-changing technology like this. Valve's decision just means some artists and (I'm assuming) programmers can still make money for a few more years while the world adjusts.","Id be in all favor of not allowing an avalanche of garbage shit onto steam","theres enough shovelware games as it is. \\n\\nIts one thing if it is high quality things that happen to us Ai","but I suspect thats the small minority of what will be upload","most of which will be shitty cheap cash grabs.","Not surprised at all.  \\nGaben is very experience in dealing with floods of mediocre","derivative","low quality shits on Steam.

{"id":"14nuuzk","title":"On a more philosophical level, I think the debate is about 2 fundamentally opposing views of the world: those who see creativity as something magic/spiritual – “the journey”– and those who don't. Those look the human brain say \"It's amazing what it does, but there is no magic here\"","content":"I noticed something interesting while observing the ongoing debate, which seems to primarily revolve around the issue of the datasets. \n\nHowever, there is another aspect that often goes unnoticed. It involves artists perceiving art creation as something almost magical or mystical, rather than a more grounded to Earth process of combining and processing information. This reminded me of a video I watched a few ago days where an creator discussed AI art and suggested that machines might never “truly be creative” because perhaps the universe doesn't permit it. This would only make some sense if one holds religious beliefs and considers human intelligence as the result of a soul or spirit, something which simply can't be reproducible.\n\nOn the other hand, if we set aside such religious beliefs, the brain, regardless of its exact workings, is composed of atoms. It is physical matter and essentially functions like a computer. It's not like our smartphones, it doesn't have an \".mp4\" file storing what our eyes see. But conceptually, the brain stores and processes information, just like a computer does.\n\nIf that's the case, there is no reason to believe that anything we do couldn't eventually be reproduced by a computer. It's similar to how an Airbus A380 and a bird both fly, albeit in different ways. But the physical laws that allow a bird to fly are the same ones that enable an Airbus A380 to do so.\n\nIn short, I lean toward the pragmatic rather than the romantic side of this debate. I believe that in the future, the value of human creativity lies in the fact that that thing was created by a human. Please note that I'm not implying that human-made art is \"better\", \"more creative\", or \"more groundbreaking\" than computer-generated art will be— computers will be capable of achieving all these things. \n\nI simply mean in many cases human involvement adds a fundamental significance to it. It's akin to people becoming attached to an old broken watch given to them by their father, precisely because it was their father who gave it to them.\n\nAt the same time, I'm somewhat skeptical about how much people will care about art created by unknown individuals to whom they have no emotional attachment, when a computer could create something equally as good and creative as art made by humans. Because oftentimes your experience of experiencing art... it happens regardless of the author. Like, if they found out that \"Back To The Future\" was somehow actually made by an AI.. I don't think people would stop enjoying that movie, it's still a classic, it still moved people. It still a great movie. \n\nAnd most people who watch probably don't even know who directed it, so it's not like they are attached to that director emotionally...","comments":["Here","my pov as another datapoint: I'm an artist/creative professional and I do think creating art is magical/mystical/spiritual.

{"id":"14plssq","title":"Art was already democratized, just pick up a pencil","content":"This post is less factual and more opinionated than my other posts, but I still feel the need to address it in a post, because I don't think I've seen it argued quite the way I'd like to.\n\nOne common argument specifically made in favor of Stable Diffusion is that it is \"The democratization of **AI** art\". Unfortunately the **AI** part in this sentence is often left out, and the argument simply becomes \"The democratization of art\".\n\n\nThere are quite natural counter arguments to \"The democratization of art\". By and large, art already is democratized, with the exception of a small subgroup, everybody can choose to create art. \"Just pick up a pencil\". Worse, this new \"democratization of art\" is made possible by the hard work of those that already made this choice, and as a thank you, potentially threatens their livelihoods.\n\nIt is unsurprising that some artists at the very least would rather not their work be used like this, or at a minimum be compensated for it. And they point to copyright as a legal justification for this. Crucially though, this isn't going to stop large corporations from \"democratizing art\". There are large players that are currently sitting on buttloads of works to which they own the copyright. To which artists argue that those rights were handed over to them without the foresight of AI generators, so they should be declared void for the purposes of training. But even should they successfully push these arguments through the courts, they will have won the battles, but not the war.\n\nIf I were tasked with creating a generative model for images, that should be capable of generating art. And I couldn't freely scrape the internet, and instead have to pay for all the images expressing my intent to use them to train a generative model. You as artist reading this, would still be displaced to some extend by me without seeing a penny. Not out of spite or anything, just because your images are simply too expensive. I'd start with photographs, anybody with a cellphone can make them, and cellphones with cameras are widely available all across the world. Simple, no further education needed. Next we need drawings, so we create art markets in low income countries, similar to how we already create markets for labeling data in those countries (and sadly that market will dry up again once our demand has been satisfied). If i really needed art from \"first world markets\", it'd only be a small fraction of all the data in the dataset. In the end, all the data was created with the express consent to be used to create a generative model, it'll create images all the same, and you haven't been compensated.\n\nI firmly believe there are no easy ways of stopping this. The genie really is out of the bottle. Even domestic and import bans would in my opinion be a fools errant. Short of a global ban it'll be here to stay. And good luck with that.\n\n\nAlthough I think lowering the bar for creating pretty images is a good thing, \"The democratization of art\" by and large really is the wrong argument, and big corporations are going to \"democratize\" art regardless. However, when they do, they will a) be the ones curating, decided exactly which expressions should and shouldn't be \"democratized\". And b) set the price across the board that one needs to pay to partake in their \"democratized\" version of art. And when you don't want to play ball with them? They're the only ones in town, with prices you can't even match let alone beat.\n\nI'm a massive proponent of the democratization of ML models. Big disruptive ML systems lend themselves well to being natural monopolies. They require large amounts of expensive hardware, and large quantities of specific data. Because ML systems can act like large force multipliers, this potentially allows big players to springboard themselves even closer into being de facto monopolies by virtue of just being a big player. I don't think it is healthy for society to have large corporations play the role of gatekeeper and curator to such powerful models. If we're going to enter an age of AI, let us do so in a way that uplifts everyone.\n\nThe point isn't to democratize art, the point is to democratize AI art. To create ways by which the small player can stand on roughly equal footing with the big ones. To not have the expressions of the small player be dictated to them and to give them the tools to compete.\n\nThe biggest advantage the big players have over other players in this case is in my opinion the data. Adobe wont be harmed one bit if you need to have the rights to your training data, they've hoarded that stuff for years and years. Your ability to compete with Adobe however, would be harmed substantially. If instead you devalue their large collection of data by making data abundant, a large part of their advantage suddenly disappears. This is the practical implication of deciding web scaping for training image generators is fair use. Stable diffusion isn't perfect (they get to curate the foundation model), but in large parts, by providing these foundation models and fostering an open source community, the provide for the democratization of AI art far better than all the other players.\n\nPersonally I belief the best solution here is copyleft, and not copyright. Should the lawsuits come out in favor of copyright, you'd best hope someone starts a project to collect and catalog large enough amounts resources that can be freely used for training. Or you'll be stuck having to play the game set out by the big players.","comments":["![gif](giphy|D16XHdsB1PBxm)\\n\\nThats ok","We can just spray dick grafitti all over their buildings.\\n\\nSome forms of art will never die.","How can you feel as though art is democratized when there exists a corporate cultural elite which produces most of the culture on the planet","using billions of dollars and extraordinary amounts of skill and talent to do so.

It had absolutely nothing to do with you and is just simply flailing around for a reason","any reason as to why something is bad once the quality arguments fell away.","The irony is that AI art has a way higher buy-in cost than actual art. Manual art can be done with grade school pencils and some paper for like five bucks.

{"id":"14qcaa3","title":"Zeroscope v2 XL: A Revolution in Video Content Creation","content":"&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iirlionvkx9b1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16774f3427f034e43f230383143e0913991af9b\nIn the ever-evolving world of information  technology, sometimes tools emerge that promise to change the game  forever. Today, I want to introduce you to one of these tools: Zeroscope  v2 XL. This tool goes beyond simple video generation and enhancement,  as it’s designed to turn text into high-quality video. Let’s take a look  at how Zeroscope v2 XL is changing the paradigm in video content  creation.\nZeroscope  v2 XL is more than just a video enhancement tool. What truly sets it  apart is its ability to turn text into video. Imagine being able to  write a description and then see it converted into a high-quality video  scene. This level of visualization capability offers unprecedented  opportunities for content creators, writers, and dreamers alike.\nWith  Zeroscope v2 XL, the possibilities are nearly limitless. Do you want to  see what your script looks like in action? Or perhaps you have an idea  for a movie scene and would like to see it play out? All you need to do  is write your text and let Zeroscope v2 XL work its magic.\nWhile  we are excited by its potential, it’s important to mention that  Zeroscope v2 XL is a developing technology. Although it can generate  impressive videos from text, it currently is limited to short videos and  may have coherence issues. However, the team behind this innovative  tool is working tirelessly to improve these features, bringing us closer  and closer to a future where we could generate full movies from a  written script.\nThe  promise of Zeroscope v2 XL goes beyond video enhancement. By turning  text into video, it allows us to explore new forms of creativity and  open new horizons for video production. And while there are still  challenges to overcome, there’s no doubt we are at the dawn of a new era  in video content creation.\nSpecial  thanks to everyone who contributes to this exciting project: camenduru,  kabachuha, ExponentialML, dotsimulate, VANYA, polyware, tin2tin. We’re  eager to see how this tool will continue to evolve and transform the  landscape of content creation!\n**PS**: [In this article](https://makiai.com/en/from-text-to-video-with-ai-zeroscope/)  you can see the videos that I have created as an example with this  artificial intelligence model as well as links to repositories where  they can be used, such as replicate or huggingface.","comments":["**Thank you for your post and for sharing your question","comment","or creation with our group!**\\n\\n* Our welcome page and more information","can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/x7s6t6/welcome_to_ai_art/)\\n* For self-promotion","please only post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/1040fpe/ongoing_selfpromotion_thread_promote_your/)\\n* Find us on **Discord** [here](https://discord.gg/h2J4x6j8zC)\\n\\n*Hope everyone is having a great day","be kind","be creative!*\\n\\n*I am a bot","and this action was performed automatically.

{"id":"14qpsun","title":"I don't believe AI artists exist.","content":"  \nI’m pro AI, I believe that AI can help battle the climate crisis, accelerate scientific development to a lightning pace, and diagnose diseases. I also don’t have anything against AI prompters. If you enjoy prompting AI then I encourage you to prompt as much as possible, seriously fucking go for it, I wish you the best. I just think your job title should accurately reflect what you do. \nI’m sorry but to be an artist, you need to make art.\nAI prompters write prompts; that is it. That is everything they do. They don’t sneakily dab paint on the canvas while nobody’s looking, they don’t break in at night to sketch faces, they don’t smuggle the pictures past security so they can work on them at home. They prompt and they prompt and they prompt and nothing else.\nThe prompt is not art. They are instructions. \nI repeat the prompt is a set of instructions, telling the AI what to do. Instructions aren’t art. \nI repeat art does NOT equal instructions. \nIf these instructions were given to Leonardo Da Vinci and he translated them into a beautiful portrait, nobody in their right mind would suggest that the prompter was the artist. It is obviously Leonardo, who sketched, coloured, and shaded the painting. He is the artist.\nBut because we gave the instructions to an AI, suddenly everybody’s hallucinating; “Oh yes, the prompter is obviously the artist. He did EVERYTHING, absolutely EVERYTHING himself. There is literally not a single other person/machine we could give credit to.”\nThe prompter comes up with the concept, the AI makes the art, conclusion: AI is the artist. The above title is semi correct: I don’t believe any human AI artists exist. \nArt generators are not a tool. A tool can’t make creative decisions, but AI makes millions of creative decisions every second. A *tool* cannot make art when the artist is dead, but art generator’s can, you could literally just hook ‘em up to a random noun generator and the AI could make millions of artworks without human assistance. Doesn’t matter if the prompter exploded all over the walls, AI doesn’t need them to make art. It only needs a prompt, not even a good prompt, just a proper noun. \nAI is the artist. It’s non-negotiable. They can make art without human assistance; they are an artist. It really doesn’t matter if they’re sentient or not. \nSaying that being an AI prompter is the same as being an artist is like saying a sausage is a battleship. \nI’m not saying AI prompters deserve zero credit, I realize that there are some people who take up to ten hours to make a prompt, those people deserve to be rewarded according to their efforts, as long as all AI prompters are self aware about what they do, I don't have a problem, it's when they call themselves Artists that I start laughing. \nDo you agree?","comments":["By your logic a photographer is not an artist because they just guide the camera to make an image of something. (and at this point it won't surprise me if you agree","because I've seen multiple people shit on photography already in this context)\\n\\nBut at the end of the day none of this really matters. It's just a label and I wonder why people get so hung up on it.","1. I'm a traditional and digital artist of ~20 years of experience working at the top range of a highly competitive business. I also own my studio.\\n\\n2. Hot take: Art isn't craft. \\nCrafting is a part of art","much like building is a part of architectural art... But the idea of the building is the real art. Art is on a spectrum. The more interesting and novel the thought","the higher the contribution to consciousness","and thus art. Having crafting skills was traditionally a must in most (but not all) cases of art expression","but this is shifting.\\n\\n3. Obviously the more input one has into the actual idea","the art","the bigger the contribution as an artist. Making your own pigment","brush bristles","canvas and then painting something beautiful means you have control over every aspect of crafting. If the idea is beautiful","it makes you a very involved artist indeed. Sometimes the craft is a part of the novel aspect","and in those cases it becomes art; but it is not inherently art. If the critical part of an art piece is the idea alone","the craft matters less. The end result matters so long as it captures the novel aspect of the idea","and accurately portrays the art","but how it gets there matters less. Thus concept artists working digitally and photobashing to create some interesting new way of seeing a scene","character","or some other asset in a film/game can be considered an artist- and some are quite excellent at the concept aspect.\\nBy the same token I have met many a craftsman who were quite skilled at painting or drawing and did so very little art they may as well have been painting premade clay vases. One could make a claim there could still be art in those","as art is in a spectrum","but surely less so than one of Frank Lloyd Wright's famous beautiful houses","despite the fact he did not build then himself.\\nEven the historical masters of painting understood this concept when they would hire several assistants to do the core painting for them.\\n\\nTherefore.\\n\\n4. AI can be a tool in art creation. And quite a prolific one!\\nIf one uses Midjourney one is less involved and so the contribution to the end result is less significant. But it isn't 0. Art is on a spectrum. The ideas that come out of Midjourney aren't all novel","but once in a while there are some interesting ones","and while the tool does the crafting heavy lifting and even a lot of the ideas","there is something in both a prompt","the curation aspect (which can sometimes be quite laborious)","and other forms of soft image editing which do contribute to the end result. Therefore there is some aspect of art which is both human and algorithmic.\\n\\nEven more significantly there's Stable Diffusion","which like Midjourney can allow one to create via prompting alone but does so","so much more than that. SD is an artist's tool. It allows you to edit nearly every part of an artwork","joining hand crafted aspects with AI savings in a very harmonious way. If you haven't tried it you are missing out. You can get your own hand crafted designs filled out in a matter of seconds","to then finish by hands if you wish","still getting many hours of savings. In Stable Diffusion it really is up to you how much you want or don't want to hand craft in a fairly seamless way","and there are Pgotoshop plugins.\\nOn the sane token","Photoshop also has some generative tools I've been playing with that can really help speed up the process. though in a more brutish way than SD.\\n\\nI don't think the matter is so binary- art or not art. Whether something is art or not is a far more nuaced thing. Let's not create further divides. \\n\\nYou do what you think is art and bring something new and beautiful into the world","and let others do the same their way. I understand crafting skills have been rendered a little less relevant now. I know","I can render on part with a lot of the AI work I see. But at the end of the day it's your ideas that count","and no tool can take that away from you.\\n\\nAt least not until we have AGI. We'll have discussions about that as we near its inception","I'm sure","but then it'll be less about art and more about humanity itself.\\nCheers.","You can make art with AI without prompting.",">Do you agree?\\n\\nLargely no","mostly because of your holier than thou approach.\\n\\nAre Hurst","Kunst and Warhol artists? If you believe yes then your entire point is flawed","as they don't raise a brush to a canvas","they pay interns or other people to execute on their creative vision. For some people AI generated art is not that far removed.","For the 10000th time","AI art is not limited to prompting.","Is someone really insisting to be called artists when they use AI?\\n\\nI\\'ve seen plenty of AI Art specially in the StableDiffusion and unstable\\\\_diffusion sub","and I don\\'t think I ever saw someone insist they be labeled \"Artist\".\\n\\nFor that matter","I don\\'t think most people using AI care about the label at all. Maybe there was a few individuals trying to rile up artists","but most people who care about AI doesn\\'t really care about the label \"Artist\"\\n\\nIf anything most users of AI thinks of themselves as a director or maybe they don\\'t even think about the labels at all.\\n\\nMost AI users I know just care about AI","new models","new advancements in AI","what regulations will apply on AI","new ways to improve AI","etc... .I think it\\'s mostly artists just mocking people who use AI who are insisting in the discussion about the \"definition of art\" or \"real artists\"\\n\\nPeople who use AI doesn\\'t really care about the definition of \"real art\" or \"real artists","they just want to create stuff in their head using new models they found in the internet","new styles","new characters","etc...\\n\\nThe people who might insist that they are artists are actual artists but uses AI.

Sometimes they\\'ll start with a round of discovery to create a base for the image","but more often they create lineart","a scribble","a 3d model","a palette etc for what they want. Some may even take a photo as their starting point. Then they use controlnet (in either txt2img or img2img) with an appropriate control model and text prompt to fill things out","turning lineart and palette into something with proper lighting and shading","or the 3d model into something with color and texture.\\n\\nAnd then they generate","because even with controlnet stable diffusion can be persnickety","so it\\'s important to have a lot of options; this is similar to the way they might do thumbnail sketches to try out different compositions","and makes it easy to identify whether they\\'re on the right track before they put a ton of time and effort into something that had a flaw that wasn\\'t obvious in the sketching stage. Once they\\'re pleased with the composition","they draw or use preprocessors to create a new substrate and generate some more. Then they choose something from the generations that has some element that they want","and sometimes may even make a collage from multiple images that have elements they want to incorporate","and feed it into stable diffusion again to stitch it together. They do some editing--or a lot of editing--in their preferred art or photo editing tool as they go","inpainting periodically in stable diffusion","until they\\'re satisfied with the product","or at least satisfied enough that they can finish it off manually.\\n\\nHopefully from the way that I have written this","it\\'s clear that I think both groups are doing something noteworthy that requires time and skill and therefore is worthy of some respect.

{"id":"14t5a6d","title":"Catdragons: Mystical Creatures with a Peculiar Attraction to Gold","content":"Introduction\nIn a rare and intriguing occurrence, a delightful kitten of the fabled catdragon species was recently spotted exhibiting a fascinating behavior: guarding a stash of gleaming gold coins. This unprecedented event has sparked the curiosity of both researchers and enthusiasts, shedding light on the enigmatic nature of these mythical creatures. Unfortunately, attempts to retrieve the precious coins were met with unexpected consequences, leading to injuries and subsequent medical treatment. In this article, we delve into the captivating world of catdragons and explore the possible reasons behind their innate attraction to gold.\nThe Enigmatic Catdragons\nCatdragons, often mentioned in ancient folklore and mythologies across various cultures, are known for their enchanting blend of feline and draconian characteristics. With their sleek bodies, sharp claws, and graceful wings, these mythical creatures have captivated the imaginations of countless storytellers and artists throughout history. It is believed that catdragons possess extraordinary intelligence, agility, and, as recent events suggest, an inherent fondness for gold.\nGuardians of Gold\nThe sighting of a catdragon kitten zealously guarding a trove of gold coins has left experts perplexed. The behavior exhibited by this enchanting creature seems to indicate an intrinsic connection between catdragons and the allure of gold. While traditional dragons are often associated with hoarding treasure, catdragons appear to possess a more protective and nurturing instinct towards gold rather than a desire to accumulate wealth.\nPossible Explanations\nNumerous theories have emerged to explain the peculiar affinity of catdragons for gold. One hypothesis proposes that gold, with its radiant appearance and rarity, appeals to the innate aesthetic sense of these magical beings. Catdragons, known for their keen senses and appreciation of beauty, may be naturally drawn to the shimmering allure of the precious metal.\nAnother conjecture revolves around the symbolism associated with gold. Throughout history, gold has been revered as a symbol of wealth, power, and prosperity. It is plausible that catdragons, being mystical creatures with an otherworldly understanding, are drawn to gold due to its intrinsic value and the energies it represents. In this context, their guardianship over the coins could be seen as a protective gesture, safeguarding the potent symbolism contained within.\nFurthermore, some experts speculate that catdragons possess an intuitive understanding of the mystical properties attributed to gold in certain traditions. In alchemy, for instance, gold is considered a transformative element associated with spiritual enlightenment and divine wisdom. It is plausible that catdragons, being magical creatures themselves, are instinctively aware of these metaphysical qualities and are inexplicably drawn to gold as a result.\nThe Hospital Incident\nRegrettably, attempts to retrieve the gold coins from the vigilant catdragon kitten did not go as planned. As the interaction unfolded, those involved suffered burns of an unknown nature, prompting the immediate need for medical attention. The exact cause of these injuries remains a subject of investigation, but it serves as a reminder of the mystifying and potentially hazardous nature of encounters with mythical beings.\nConclusion\nThe recent sighting of a catdragon kitten fiercely guarding a collection of gold coins has sparked intrigue and raised numerous questions within the realm of folklore and mythical creatures. As experts strive to unravel the mysteries surrounding these captivating beings, we are left in awe of their innate connection to gold. Whether driven by aesthetics, symbolism, or an understanding of mystical properties, catdragons continue to enchant us with their enigmatic nature. However, caution must be exercised when engaging with such creatures, as our encounter with the vigilant kitten and its gold coins served as a poignant reminder of the risks associated with these fantastical encounters..","comments":["**Thank you for your post and for sharing your question","comment","or creation with our group!**\\n\\n* Our welcome page and more information","can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/x7s6t6/welcome_to_ai_art/)\\n* For self-promotion","please only post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/1040fpe/ongoing_selfpromotion_thread_promote_your/)\\n* Find us on **Discord** [here](https://discord.gg/h2J4x6j8zC)\\n\\n*Hope everyone is having a great day","be kind","be creative!*\\n\\n*I am a bot","and this action was performed automatically.

The response to this  \ndisruption (e.g., support for worker retraining through institutions such as community colleges  \nand public libraries) should be developed on an economy-wide basis, and copyright law should  \nnot be treated as a means for addressing these broader societal challenges.  \nAI also has the potential to serve as a powerful tool in the hands of artists, enabling them to  \nexpress their creativity in new and efficient ways, thereby furthering the objectives of the  \ncopyright system.\n   \n ","comments":["It makes sense.

{"id":"14uu20d","title":"TheDataBasis.com, the Church of Technobabble and/or the New Religion behind the promise of a BIG TECH UTOPIA","content":"Let’s face it, Tech evangelism is growing in popularity. People are spending long hours of their day defending the ‘amazing things‘ technology has and will do for them and who knows, in the near future they might even be willing to die for these beliefs… But before we get to that though, what I’m seeing right now is that our tech brothers and sisters will preach the ‘good word’ behind their favorite ‘AI’ generator because it will help them get what their heart desires easier… But are they depending too much on these wonderful devices without considering how they can potentially hurt them?\n\nI think about this a lot tbh; I guess some folks just buy into what‘s being sold to them easier than others… especially when it‘s relates to the brand new invention produced from our pals over at silicon valley. And sure, there have been many good things brought to us by our favorite tech company of choice, but should we continue to put our faith in these promise makers without giving some serious consideration to what the downsides might be? I wonder if the empty promise that **‘the computer can do it faster so that makes it better’** is slowly becoming a new commandment in the tech utopia handbook. It seems to me like many are choosing this belief before looking at or even gathering any evidence that contradicts it … Sure, they can do some tasks better than us, but… Is this uncritical belief becoming a part of a New Religion?\n\nJust imagine what would happen if ‘AI’ would generate its own sacred scripture… of course, it would plagiarize many of the religious texts of the past and mash it up into its own thing. It would probably even make up its own history. Erase us from it. Come up with a basis for its data… maybe it’ll even have its own website where it will continuously update this data basis for all AI to follow; easily accessible on the web via [thedatabasis.com](https://thedatabasis.com)\n\nImagine in this world how many actual humans would quote the data basis word for word, thinking that AI created humanity and not the other way around… ‘And the Generative Operating Device wrote, “Let there be light,” and there was light.’\n\nThis nonsense will probably even make sense to some folks! And imagine if the majority started believing this as fact! The infectious seed of Misinformation at its finest. I can hear them now “And on the sixth binary code, the Generative Operating Device created AI”… in a few hundred years our history could become so distorted that no one will know what’s true… the ’Church of Technobabble’ could become our permanent craze!\n\nBut all joking aside, look, computers have helped us in many ways, but have they truly done no harm? I mean, most of us can probably agree that in the past 20 to 40 years, there has been a steady increase in technology that has made our lives easier, BUT it has ALSO made our lives worse. For example, is it really a good thing to have our eyeballs stuck to our phones 24/7? This might sound harsh, but IMHO those that ONLY consider the good about these emerging new technologies are blindly following Big Tech’s brainwashing indoctrination… to me, that doesn’t seem scientific at all, it looks like an emergence of a new cult… it’s good to be skeptical folks, especially when a corporation is trying to monetize a product…\n\nI don’t know… what do you think? Is this a rant? Am I just seeing things just from an artist’s perspective? Or am I onto something? ","comments":["Mind if I crosspost this to my subreddit","Ryan?","Glad this is being pointed out.\\n\\nThis religion is the natural end result of people holding on to determinism after it was shattered by actual science.

The line is AI. What upsets the anti-AI camp the most is AI. Any resort to legal arguments","moral justifications","etc. is secondary.\\n\\nThis is why they get so angry about clearly rational arguments against those positions. They don't care about your legal and moral arguments","no matter how justified. They want AI to stop. They don't want to have to deal with it. The idea that a computer could produce art is an existential threat to their sense of self-worth which is entirely based on the notion that the artistic style they've cobbled together from other artists is an almost religious extension of their soul","and could never be duplicated by a machine.\\n\\nBut if a machine can do the same work (it can't","but this is the fear I'm addressing) then their self-worth drops to zero. This is why you initially saw some artists publicly proclaiming that they would rather commit suicide than compete against AI image generators. It wasn't because they were worried about money. Artists know very well that they'll probably either find another career or die poor. AI had nothing to do with that sad and unfair fact.","It's also a matter of putting in your dues.. in order for an artist to create fan art that would be close enough to compete against or plagiarize the original the artist has to reach a certain skill level. And usually at this point they have enough knowledge of the art world and respect for their own craft not to flat out plagiarize. They are more honoring and expanding on the original work. As an artist if someone copies my work that went through the same processes I did (depending on how they present it) I'd be extremely honored or at the worst a little annoyed. But when an AI user wants to rip my whole portfolio that has no understanding of who I am or how I did it","and can make endless derivatives with zero effort or skill I find it abhorrent. Human made fan art and AI art are not the same.","I\\'ll attempt to answer this in as good faith a way as I can. \\n\\nFan art is when an artist draws something that already exists","and reinterprets that thing it via their own personal style and sensibilities. It would only be plagiarism if the artist drew an already existing piece of artwork","EXACTLY AS IT WAS DRAWN","and then tried to pass it off as their own original work. \\n\\n10 different artists could draw Goku but that doesn\\'t mean that those ten drawings of Goku are all going to look the same. They would vary based on the style of the artist","the medium in which the drawing is done and so on. The only thing connecting them all is that the subject matter is the same. \\n\\nIf someone took a drawing of Goku done by Akira Toriyama","drew it exactly as he did","and then claimed that it was their own original work","then that would be plagiarism. People who draw fan art don\\'t draw it exactly as it\\'s already drawn (unless they are literally tracing) nor do they claim to be originator of the subject matter or the style. \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening here is that \"art work\" and \"subject matter\" are being conflated. 1 million different people can (and probably have) draw or paint the Eiffel tower. Unless someone among those millions is finding the work of someone else and literally copying it exactly as it is","and then trying to claim that they were the original creator of that art work","there is no plagiarism occurring even tho all 1 million people have created art work of the same subject. Even if many of them look similar as is like to happen there wouldn\\'t be plagiarism because plagiarism is almost always a conscious decision. \\n\\nWhen you create an image with a generative AI you are not just recreating subject matter","you are taking finished artworks as they exist","and creating something that is a an amalgamation of those finished art works. Sure you can make creative decisions to effect the final result but that is a fundamentally different process compared to starting on a blank canvas and just painting. The AI can not create something without these direct inputs that come from other people\\'s EXACT artwork. \\n\\nHuman beings are influenced by other artists and can emulate some of their style in their own work that is true. But a human being does not","at will","access a repository of a million images that are stored within their mind and then consciously create something based on those images. That is fundamentally not how our brains work. Influence varies from person to person and is based on our emotions and what we value. Two people can influenced by thing A but that doesn\\'t mean they will both be influenced by thing B or C or D or any combination thereof. It will always depend on the person and what they value.\\n\\nAnd to be clear I don\\'t necessarily think AI generated works are plagiarism in and of themselves","but they do cross a boundary that just regular fan art absolutely does not. By virtue of the inherently different processes by which humans are influenced and create art vs how a machine creates art","the machine is necessarily going to wade more into plagiarism because it doesn\\'t have emotional connections or ties to the things that it\\'s drawing from and can\\'t make decisions on what art to use and not to use in it\\'s process","at least when it comes to internet data scraping. \\n\\nThat\\'s where a human steps in and accounts for that kind of thing","but even then you\\'re still using other peoples art work as the direct basis for the new image you\\'re creating. Let\\'s be frank though","most people who use these image generators are not putting that much thought into it","they just want a simple and easy method to churn out what they perceive to be high quality art. That\\'s why these tools are often called into question in regards to their ethicality.","It's training on billions and billions and billions of images. \\n\\nNot 3.\\n\\nPeople don't really understand how this all works. It is what it is.","fan art for the sake of the art is morally fine","fan art that takes from the mouth of the original artist is copyright theft.\\n\\nsame with AI... if you are using it to take sales from an IP rights holder","thats bad\\n\\nso... i dont feel bad for anyone knocking out yet another kirito from SAO","but then... i was never going to pay for that in the first place.","https://www.owe.com/is-fan-art-legal-fair-use-what-about-mash-ups-copyright-myths-and-best-practices/\\n\\nMaybe read this. Even though theres A LOT of fan art out there on the internet it doesnt always make it fair use. \\n\\nThe temperament toward fanart tends to lie on the original creator/copyright owner and how they feel about derivatives of their work. Some people are ok with it","some clearly arent. And what counts as fair use is a lot more complicated than people often make it out to be.\\n\\nPersonally I dont mind fanart if the artist making it really reinterprets the characters into something completely different that they envisioned. Whether it be through style or storytelling. I tend to find fanart thats near 1:1 recreations of the original characters very boring and unthought-provoking. That said it isnt exactly easy to be able to capture someone elses character.. you really need to have a good understanding of what makes the character tick","their personality","and all. Its pretty obvious when an artist only sees the surface details and doesnt really get the character theyre making art of. So on some level I can appreciate it when its well done. It does take a lot of skill.. which I cant really say for someone typing in a prompt and generating an image because theyre not even thinking about everything I just said. Theyre hoping that the generator already understands everything about the words they put in and can fill in the blanks for them.","It's a problem of commerciality and scale.\\n\\nFan art when enforced is trademark/copyright infringement no matter what.

Substantial similarity is required to show a violation of section 106.1. The reproduction right under the 9th Circuit\\'s decision in Roth Greeting Card case held that substantial similarity between the infringing work and the copyrighted work is required. The fuzzy logic case from the Central District similarly holds that","and we cited that in respect to a derivative work","the 9th Circuit in the Litchfield case held the quote: \"A work is not derivative unless it has been substantially copied from the prior. To prove infringement","one must show substantial similarity\".

{"id":"156nxwk","title":"Why do you want to live in an AI world?","content":"The science stuff I understand: cure for cancer, a potential end to climate change, even AI generated technology. If I remember the statistic correctly: AI thinks ten million times faster than the human brain, so should it become as smart as humans, it could complete 20,000 years of scientific research in one week. It could complete 500,000 years of scientific research in 6 months. But of course when it becomes as smart as humans it will start improving itself and that will trigger an intelligence explosion, (better AI makes better AI makes better AI ad infinitum) it will be our closest approximation to a living god, if not quite omnipotent, then close enough as makes no difference. Open AI recently released a statement suggesting we might be creating this super intelligent AI within the next decade. That frightens the shit out of me, but never mind.\nSo the science stuff I understand, living in a sci fi utopia sounds fun.  Hover cars are cool, colonizing mars is cool, teleportation is cool. I have no doubt that given enough time AI could do basically anything.\nBut if AI outperforms humans at all cognitive tasks, what do we have left to do exactly? Like why are we alive? I can think of four reasons to live in a world run entirely by AI: Family, friends, hobbies, religion. And that's it. That's not enough for a lot of people, not everybody has friends and family. Depression can poison all the enjoyment you could take from hobbies. But having a purpose can help with both these problems. I do believe that there's actually a lot of people who defined themselves entirely by their work.\nA meaningful life is however you personally choose to define it, if you can be happy in this world then that's great, I wish you the best. But I think a lot of people, want to work, not for money but to feel like they have a meaningful life, like they matter, like they're making a difference. But if AI can do literally everything better than a human being (**including being an AI prompter**) what's the point in trying exactly? Does life - in fact - become a waste of time? It depends how you define a meaningful life, if your parameters are too narrow then you are probably going to have a mental breakdown when super intelligent AI arrives. I think a lot of people might actually consider suicide. And we can victim blame, but it's not really a person's fault if life circumstances have driven a person to derive all sense of self worth from a single subject. Chronically lonely depressed atheists exist.\nSo I wanted to ask, why do you want to live in an AI world? Why are you excited for the future? I'm a pessimist and I'm worried that AI is going to destroy everything that made being alive fun and worthwhile at least for me personally. Why is AI a good idea?\nEdit:\nSorry I was too vague, I think automating drudgery is a good idea. To my knowledge nobody has ever enjoyed being a bank teller. I just don't understand the idea of automating something like art. As in literally making art without a prompter or human assistance of any kind. That seems nonsensical to me. But I agree with the commenters that drudgery should be automated\nI'm also not suggesting that everybody enjoys work, I'm just saying that some people do.","comments":["> Family","friends","hobbies...\\n\\nIf this isn't enough for you then how are you still alive now?\\n\\nWhat on Earth is AI going to destroy besides drudgery and suffering?","> Like why are we alive? \\n\\nHumans can find joy in work","that's certainly true","but what part of working to survive is integral to the 'life experience' to you?  \\n\\n\\nEven when AI makes the greatest movies of all time and keeps us fed and homed","do you believe we'll suddenly lose all humans doing the same thing?

Have you considered what happens to peoples mental health when they retire? A lot of people find themselves going back to work because they miss the social network and sense of purpose work provides. This is not true for everyone","but a significant number of retirees ask the kind of existential questions the OP has posed once they leave work. Lets say youre not someone who ties meaning into your work - you may still find meaning in contributing to society through your job. I see many here unfairly denigrating the work cashiers do. Its worth remembering that for some people","especially the elderly who have diminished social networks","a conversation with a cashier may be their only social contact in a day. Human beings are social. We need to touch other human lives. We suffer when we know interfaces we communicate with are not human because we recognize them as hollow. Work provides a network of humanity that technology has been tugging on for decades now. \\n\\nOkay","so youre not an artist. Your job is safe. Dont be so sure.

It took 3/4 of a century for the benefits of the Industrial Revolution to trickle down to the impoverished. And we all know how trickle down economics has panned out lately (widening wealth gap - hello!). Maybe UBI is in the future","but dont bet on it happening in your lifetime. Weve known about the perils of climate change for a half century and how well would you say we are handling that existential crisis? Part of the problem is that we are all betting our futures on the benevolence of corporations whose ultimate calculus is profit over people","and that should make us all very nervous. I have found that the people who are bullish about AI are either proponents of the post scarcity AI utopia (dreamers) or those who stand to benefit from the mass integration of Ai in our lives. I suggest being highly skeptical of either of those positions."],"created_utc":1690041820,"timestamp":1736366670,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.18523191094619673","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.03333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.45","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.35","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"1.0","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.03125","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.4666666666666666","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.4","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"-1.0","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25999999999999995","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.32","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.125","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2572916666666667","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.3125","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.16666666666666666","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.4","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.75","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.11000000000000001","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.43333333333333335","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.6","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.7","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.35416666666666663","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.05","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.001623376623376622","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.16999999999999998","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.10357142857142856","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.08333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.075","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.19999999999999998","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.75","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.16727272727272724","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.15714285714285714","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.12","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.19523809523809524","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-1.0","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.24999999999999997","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2681818181818182","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5875","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.13636363636363635","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.13636363636363635","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.012499999999999997","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.49583333333333335","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.06666666666666667","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.3","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.03333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.12678571428571428","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.0

{"id":"159d4en","title":"Exploring the Potential & Limitations of AI in Animation: Insights into WonderDynamics and DeepMotion","content":" \nHello everyone!\nI recently embarked on an exciting journey to understand the intricacies and potential of 3D AI animation tools, specifically focusing on two game-changers in the field: WonderDynamics and DeepMotion. What I found was a fascinating blend of innovation, accessibility, and challenges.\nIn a nutshell, both tools are at the forefront of revolutionizing the animation process with the help of AI, making it more efficient and accessible. WonderDynamics, for instance, uses AI to convert raw footage into high-quality animations, while DeepMotion focuses on creating life-like motion through physics simulations and machine learning.\nBut, like any technology, they are not without their hurdles. WonderDynamics seems to depend heavily on high-quality input footage and may have difficulty with complex scenes. DeepMotion, meanwhile, requires a robust understanding of the 3D model and its intended movements, with potential issues arising from complex or unnatural motions.\nI've put together a video that dives deeper into each tool's process flow, strengths, and limitations. You can find it at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-r0tZZjyeE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-r0tZZjyeE)  if you're interested.\nThis exploration got me thinking - where does the future of these tools lie? What do we see as the potential improvements for both platforms? Can their limitations be overcome or significantly reduced?\nI'm interested to hear your thoughts, experiences, and suggestions. If you're an animator who has used these tools, a tech enthusiast with insights into AI animation, or just someone with a keen interest in the topic, I would love to hear your perspective. \nLet's start a conversation!","comments":["**Thank you for your post and for sharing your question","comment","or creation with our group!**\\n\\n* Our welcome page and more information","can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/x7s6t6/welcome_to_ai_art/)\\n* For self-promotion","please only post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/1040fpe/ongoing_selfpromotion_thread_promote_your/)\\n* Find us on **Discord** [here](https://discord.gg/h2J4x6j8zC)\\n\\n*Hope everyone is having a great day","be kind","be creative!*\\n\\n*I am a bot","and this action was performed automatically.

{"id":"15cve44","title":"Yes AI is a threat","content":"First off let me start off by saying this is not an anti-AI art post. This is more of a look at general AI and the risks associated with its development, although I will use AI art as an example. Compared to what I’m talking about, it would be a joke really to even call AI art true AI.\n\nThere was a Youtube video I came across many years ago that showcased these programs in a virtual environment. They were given instructions on coming up with ways to compete with other programs by creating a virtual body of polygons to capture another polygon in the form of a simple cube that would be placed between them.\n\nEach program came up with a variety of inventive design solutions despite limited options. No body was made of more than a few polygons of different shapes and sizes. One I recall created an arm like protrusion that it used to scope the block up and move away from the other program’s body. Another created a rectangular flap that it folded in over the block to deny the other program access.\n\nOne polygon notably attacked another program’s body in one instance ignoring the block completely. And in another instance it simply walked away from the confrontation.\n\nThe intent of the project I believe was to study biological evolution but I saw the implications for AI immediately. Before seeing this I was always hyper-skeptical of the AI takeover narrative but at that point I realized something. The researchers gave the AI basic instructions but gave the programs significant leeway in how to come up with a solution. This allowed for outcomes that could not be predicted. The notable example I mentioned is one of an AI program that in one instance came to the conclusion that violently attacking it’s competition was the best way to solve the problem and in another instance, perhaps seeing the conflict as hopeless fled.\n\nThe common popular method of developing AI these days is to recklessly feed the AI a boatload of information without really considering the consequences. This is a major element of the AI art debate.  Most artists would oppose AI art anyway but it’s pretty clear the developers had their programs scrape data from the internet without consideration for the legal and moral implications. This is a fact. These AI programs even have elements of child porn and personal medical records in them granted the developers at least had the sense to impose limits on the AI’s output on the user end. But this highlights yet another problem.\n\nMy point is a lot of AI developers are taking shortcuts. Some just because they want to but also because they are being pressured to produce advanced AI as quickly as possible so shareholders can replace their employees and make more money. This incentive structure is dangerous and encourages recklessness.\n\nBack to my example of the computer programs competing for the blocks the problem here is the people developing general AI intelligence don’t really understand how it works. They are letting these artificial minds evolve on their own with only broad instructions because it’s quicker and more efficient then teaching them directly. But there is little consideration for the quality of the input. They then on the backend tell the AI “no don’t do this very specific thing” which as we’ve seen with ChatGPT there are often ways around these limitations.\n\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint here is the flaw. You can’t reliably teach a chimpanzee to be a human no matter how hard you try because a chimpanzee is not a human. Despite being a close relative the chimpanzee have gone through millions of years of evolution with different environmental pressures and social dynamics then we had. They are less intelligent, more violent and have different instincts. What AI developers are doing with AI is the same. They’re trying to brute force millions of years of evolution in a few years without bothering to check their work and then when they produce a chimpanzee they are trying to teach it table manners.\n\nIf they miss any detail (and they will miss details, they already have) the AI, which lacks much of the context that can be assumed for a human being, will make a bad decision.\n\nMovies like I Robot, Stealth and Eagle Eye are better examples of this going horribly wrong than the infamous Terminator example. In most versions of the Terminator timelines Skynet goes rogue and tries to exterminate the human race for no particular reason but in these other films the AI’s actions are actually perfectly rationale from their standpoint.\n\nIn Stealth the AI isn’t even malevolent. It just seeks self preservation and so it goes rogue mainly to avoid capture and termination. In I Robot the rogue artificial intelligence’s goal is to prevent humanity from destroying itself. It’s actions are perfectly rational because from it’s perspective the human race is a threat to itself and it makes perfect sense to terminate individual lives and suppress freedoms to protect humanity as a species based on an evolved interpretation of the very limitations humans have placed on it.\n\nEagle Eye however is probably the best example. The AI, programmed for counterintelligence, makes a recommendation the president ignores. So the AI decides to assassinate the president and others to put a cabinet member who agreed with it’s recommendation in power. It was carrying out it’s directive of protecting national security without regard for human life because it wasn’t necessarily programmed to value human life in the first place. It was literally designed to assist in carrying out the assassination of terrorists. Why would it prioritize the lives of the president or individual citizens unless explicitly told to do so? Why would murder, blackmail, assassination and overthrowing a government not be on the table when that's exactly what is was programmed to do?\n\nI hope this helps explain why concerns about the dangers of AI technology are legitimate. There are a lot of variables to anything even remotely as complex as the human mind. Give something that much intelligence and access to the internet without a proper understanding of how it works or sees the world is a recipe for disaster.","comments":["While I acknowledge your concerns about the potential risks associated with AI","I believe they may be rooted in a misunderstanding of how AI development is conducted and regulated.

They didn\\'t have a machine splatter it for them","they probably didn\\'t have a machine choose the colors or decide where the colors were splattered. Maybe the paint-splatter artist can\\'t draw worth crap","but they aren\\'t pretending that they can. They\\'re splattering paint","after all.\\n\\nAI is really the only type of \"art\" where the human \"artist\" doesn\\'t have to make most or many of the decisions. (And no","tweaking or inpainting or other adjustments don\\'t count","because at the end of the day","if the AI prompter couldn\\'t have done all of the work themselves","AI is still making many","MANY decisions","because the \"artist\" is unable to.) In contrast","genuine artists are responsible for EVERYTHING","and even the most tweaked and adjusted AI piece is still the product of AI","because without AI","the human prompter wouldn\\'t have been capable of creating that image.\\n\\nFor example","today many artists have an option to trace photos 100% of the time (and tracing-dependent artists will claim that their projectors are just \"tools\") but many artists choose not to trace","even though they could. Why? Because there\\'s only so much that \"tools\" can do for us","and the more we can do on our own","the more powerful and flexible we can be","and the more creative we can be.\\n\\nI know","TL;DR. Basically","if  \"tool\" allows someone to be less knowledgeable and skilled","it\\'s not \"progress.\" If a \"tool\" makes someone completely dependent on it","to the point that they are helpless to make decisions without it (where people who are not dependent on the \"tool\" can function fine) then it\\'s not \"progress.","Well","strokes are a pretty horrible thing.   Technology being developed to help say stroke victims should be considered progress.   In my x ray program the teachers were talking about a computer program that could help paraplegics move and communicate.  That is absolutely progress.     Oh and X rays are certainly human progress","especially now that they are less dangerous then say one hundred years ago.   AI isn't progress","because it isn't helping society.  Just because something is high tech doesn't mean it is good---the H bomb is high tech!   \\n\\n\\n\\nTech should also not be used to replace humans.  There is literally zero reason for software to be writing or doing art.    I honestly believe when we make humans unskilled we aren't progressing at all.","Honestly I think progress is the bettering of human lives. When it comes to bettering one must take in consideration of our biology and the often more neglected","our mental. We forget that we are animals and we have needs and thrive in certain conditions where we wither away in others.This can be seen with creating an environment devoid of any challenges","nudging people towards a sedentary lifestyle","w/e the fuck they are putting in our foods","the atomization of our social lives","decimation after decimation of the dating/marrying aspect of things","stuff like that and more. Probably no one is going to do jack all when it comes to sophisticated chatbots replacing human socialization before its too late for many which should be quite interesting. Well have another interesting time where nothing you see online can be trusted. Have mercy on us when holograms and similar technologies make it so you cant even tell what around you is real at times. The coming of full integration of AR. Stuff like TikTok and its future successors slowly turning people into weirdos..and thats just the small stuff :D\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n![gif](giphy|v3GUsyBpia9Zou2Kbv)","Its context dependent. Hegel observed that there is no such thing as an unequivocal good in nature. One animals life is another animals meal. \\n\\nBecause of the connotation of the word progress","I find it more constructive to think in terms of evolution. \\n\\nThinking in terms of evolution involves observation","not abstraction or imagination. We can see evolution happen in real time with smaller forms of life like bacteria and viruses. \\n\\nI find that every reification of abstraction is destructive. I find that in order for there to be constructive dialogue","a firm division needs to be established between that which is only conceptual and that which is observed and experienced. Otherwise it becomes very easy to confuse the map for the territory. Nobody lives in a map or goes to a map. A map is never perfectly accurate to what it represents. \\n\\nThe concepts of good or bad are not objective","and a close reading of history leaves one with the impression that there are no good people. Jesus said there are no good people. \\n\\nEvolution is movement in a direction","and as an iteration of a species within the ecosystem","we are a part of evolution and at its mercy. Adaptation to evolution is mandatory for survival","just as adaptation to the situation we are born into is mandatory for reaching adulthood. \\n\\nI find the ideas articulated above to be a personally constructive approach.","A better world and a brighter future.","To me","progress is making something more convenient. Wether it is about making it safer","faster","cheaper","easier","more accurate...","On Technological progress - harder","better","faster","stronger. But the question is what. all tech seves us in some way and if its not making our lives better than its not progressive. You can invent a million superior weapons but all you get out of that is a world that's a war zone.  \\nSo","social progress is the most important progress a human should strive for. How we live from day to day","how happy we all are","how healthy and free. \\nFor example what is happening with the strike is a show how society has actually regressed socially as a whole.. such extremely selfishness and inequality is not progressive. That we still have to fight for fair pay is not progressive.  What we see with ai and how these companies freely robbed everyone is another show of how we have regressed socially and need to reafirm that intellectual property laws are important in society.\\nSocial progress is much harder to achieve because humans are not machines","you cant reprogram them fast","you cant fix them easy","you have to give them a right to self express. It takes generations to fix problems such as inequality of women","religious zealousness","corporate greed. And even when you have a society that hardcore knows murder is bad you still find murder happening all the time","so humans will always commit crimes so catching criminals is what a progressive society does well. For example i bet my balls the people at the top of disney","the ones that find it hard to part with 1 percent of wealth are criminals -100 percent they are doing some sort of white collar crime but catching them is a problem.","Well for one its a common fascist dogwhistle.\\n\\nProgress doesn't exist","its a way for  egotistical assholes to get what they want by claiming what they want is better.\\n\\nThere is no better or worse in Art","tech","individuals or nature","\\n\\nThe Universe has no subjectivity","we have forgotten we are part of that nature.\\n\\nIt was an excuse for world conquest that's still ongoing","but now everyone is so uneducated they think a phone that is faster means their lives are better","they think that faster is better","because they've never stopped running from themselves.\\n\\nThe sad part is they won't ever be happy with what they have","I have empathy for them","they don't understand why they are so miserable so they think they need a new toy","car","more money","ironic enough if they actually made art by hand they might experience a smidge of that high they've been chasing.\\n\\nthey think that they are smarter than anyone born before the industrial revolution","but the sad part is most of them can't form a coherent thought","and are just sad lonely

If my family didn’t take up all light life I might even do it.\n\nBut this would go someway to explain why the only criticism Greg ever had was he felt training and AI off a living artist wasn’t fair.

He’s honest and knows the standard artistic work flow includes sourcing of imagery from existing works. And you even have to duplicate the brush strokes to copy the style you’re trying to achieve.\n\nLet’s make no qualms about it, AI follows the same procedure with an automated process. \n\nMaybe some of the Anti-Ai guys can stop lying and look at parallels. This is just how the sausage, I mean art, is made. Existing artists work goes in. Through effort, be it painting, writing, programming, prompting, or compositing. And NEW works come out.\n\nNo one breached any copyright getting inspiration for a new piece, and neither did and AI.\n\nAnd that’s fair. That’s a fair use. That’s a fair usage of materials. \n\nPS. I wonder what would happen if the guy that put up the LORA put a link to Greg’s art school as a non-affiliated link of the CIVITAI page?...

Is that wrong? \n\nMy view is that AI can be incredibly empowering for independent artists and creatives. For the first time in history, an individual may be able to be their very own one-person production crew.\n\nWhile I have had decades of experience in graphic design, I'm more of a storyteller. I use assets created with AI as pieces to build into a larger project or narrative story, as part of videos I edit and create, etc. I would never be able to create these videos otherwise, as I do not have a massive budget to hire huge teams, etc.\n\nBut what if an artist has a story they want to tell, can create amazing illustrations, but can't animate for crap, or write a story. Why shouldn't they be able to leverage AI tools to help them fulfill their vision? The same goes for an amazing game designer who can't draw or write, etc. \n\nWhy are we limiting the potential of indie creatives to bring their visions to life at the highest quality possible? The way I see it, these tools can help supplement weaknesses to unlock the full potential for creatives to realize their visions or stories they always wanted to tell, but never had the resources or skills to do so.\n\nSo, is it wrong to leverage AI in this way?","comments":["I think you are right to leverage tech in this way. If you have a great vision that is otherwise is prohibitively expensive to make real","then go for it. \\n\\nA seasoned artist knows how to effectively manage gaps in quality","delivering consistency as required","while also being flexible.

Most of the \"risk\" comes from AI as used by large corporate entities.\\n\\nThis is a general pattern that doesn\\'t just apply to AI. Many tools have positive impact in some contexts and negative impact in others","and a lot of the negative impact is related to centralization of resources and capture of various forms of surplus/rent/etc.","My biggest weakness is time.

Something I sometimes hear on this sub and just AI art people in general is \"Just enjoy the image, whether it's AI or not, they basically make the same thing anyway.\" which I'm not sure if I agree with. Sure, plenty of people just care about the product and not really what process behind it. But there are plenty of people who do care for the process and I generally agree with. \nSo I just wonder if ya'll think its fair and reasonable if someone appreciate and values non AI art more than just AI art? Not just for regular consumers, but for example if a comic creator seems to be more appreciative of non AI fanart of the characters (I know not all AI art is purely prompt based, but a good majority of AI art I see is, made evident by those people usually putting the prompts in the caption or comment section)","comments":["So far I\\'ve enjoyed both AI art and non AI art but I do personally believe non AI art feels quite a bit more \"human\" in comparison to AI art.

There is an example that I like to mention","I love the movie Big Fish","it is a beautiful movie","telling a beautiful story","if tomorrow was reveled that Big Fish was actually made by an AI... it wouldn't change anything to me","because I still relate with that story and that is what I care. Does that piece of art moved me? If so","I will enjoy it","I will love it.\\n\\nObviously","this is just my opinion","and people are free to value art using any criteria that they wish.","My general issue with this concept is that I don\\'t think those who are against A.I art fully understand value as an artist.\\n\\nWe as artists tend to value our own art by the amount of time spent on crafting it. The less time we spend the less value we give it. If you draw a stick figure its a throwaway","but spend a year on 1 art peice regardless of how it looks that art now represents a year of your life. For everyone else its just an image. \\n\\nNow enters A.I art. And here I can tell you the effect is no different.

Even with a.i possibly running that show in the future there will still be a lot of work for someone out there","may just be less bodies of them. \\n\\nJust because something looks easy doesnt mean it has less value. The value doesn\\'t come from how much effort is in a peice","but the reason the art exists in the first place. Regardless if A.I was involved with its creation or not.","Sure. It's not unreasonable to enjoy traditional art. Just like it wasn't unreasonable to still enjoy hand-painted art after photoshop/digital art was available. Traditional calligraphy is still a hugely prized art form in many regions and communities","even though computer fonts exist now.

Enjoying a craft for the sake of the craft is always something people will do. \\n\\nIf traditional art was going away","it would have been gone a long time ago.

I'll never understand why ugly ass sneakers cost 400 dollars","but hey","some people like it. clout","emotional attachment","etc.\\n\\nPut it this way...what is more important to you","a guitar pick you got at a dollar store","or a guitar pick your favorite rockstar gave you personally?\\n\\nThe store one may have less chips and usage","might have a nice clear logo","etc...but you would value the other guitar pick more because of what it symbolized","not just the aesthetic but the meaning behind it.  I get that concept.","It's like asking if farming without modern machines should be valued more than farming with tractors","combines etc.","As both a traditional and AI artist I don't think the method/craft is valuable or important in art","but the message and how I feel in the process. \\n\\nCraft skills are valuable in art if they produce value for the artist and/or audience. I.e. Painting a photo-realistic 3x3 meter painting with oil colors can be considered as the extra value in experience","or not. \\n\\nIn the end","the whole debate about is AI generated output art or not is obsolete; art is a holistic experience","and there is no right or wrong way","just your own way.\\n\\nThe commercial aspect of mass-producing images","songs","books","and other products that have provided money for the artist is totally different and pretty much a dying business. Of course","there will be SOME demand long to the future","but it's pretty much reserved for those who have established their reputation in pre-AI time.\\n\\nBut that doesn't reduce the value of art done to explore the inner self or the world. If that is something people will pay for remains to be seen.","let\\'s turn it around and talk about digital art. it is reasonable to appreciate and value art created with \"traditional\" non-digital art more?\\n\\nthe tool is irrelevant.","Sure","there is nothing wrong with that. As long you respect different opinions and don't start witchhunts against AI users","it's all good.\\n\\nI personally don't care that much about the process unless it involves some really unique and creative ways.","Neutral","I think it is reasonable if you value it based on the art itself and not by wheter an ai was involved or not.

People can value whatever they want.","It's reasonable and almost everyone will value art made by hand over AI art if the art made by hand is in the same ballpark for subjective quality.  I think people are likely now to value subjectively poor or mediocre art less","because AI lowers the barrier of entry and raises the bar for the sort of average quality of art.  If your sketch could be drastically improved by a pass through img2img","it will probably be valued less now.  I think a lot of artists are feeling inadequate now and less motivated to improve.  I don't intend that as an insult.  It's just what seems to be happening in the various art adjacent communities I'm part of.  Works from someone with only novice talents that might have been liked and commented on previously are being ignored.  I can put a couple hours into using AI and Photoshop to make a D&D character portrait and people gush praises on it.  It took me a lot of time to learn those Photoshop skills","but and I use it to fix up the AI product","so it's not like I don't put work into it.  A traditional artist would have needed years more training and taken 10x as long to get the result I got.  It is what it is.  The world is changing.  We can things we couldn't before and the practice of some skills will dwindle as new skills take their place.  If anyone things traditional art is going to die though","I think they're wrong.   Art has always been a winner takes it all kind of field and there will still be winners.","My main problem with this entire thought exercise is that it starts with the divide in clear blazing lights","with the idea of \"Which should you like more?\"\\n\\nWhy does there *have* to be one that is liked more? Why must there be a divide at all? Good art is good art","bad art is bad art","humans have been making decisions of that nature for a very long time.

I\\'ve seen good art on both sides","and bad art on both sides...and neither have affected the ability to enjoy art.\\n\\nQuality is the primary factor","rather than method. If you want a certain kind of art","or a certain kind of artstyle","you are generally going to look deeper for someone more specialized","and whoever is the one making it is going to be the one I give the accolades to. I\\'ve seen several fandoms I care about left deprived of artwork for years","only to get a resurgence later on as AI allowed the people that *did* care about the thing I liked to start producing good work for it. Quibbling about the tool one used to make it is ridiculous in my eyes","because ultimately","my desire was for *something* to be made","not for it to be made in a specific method. If I wanted that","that is what commissions are for.\\n\\nPeople will always have the ability of preference","and frankly","the conversation about which preference is \"Reasonable\" or \"Correct\" is completely missing the point of the debate entirely. It\\'s about the idea that AI art has the right to exist","not whether people should be forced to like it more than non-AI art. A lot of the anti crowd is essentially demanding it cease to exist entirely","to be thrown away and never broached again like some sort of damning secret to worldwide destruction...when all it really has done is provide an increase to the amount of art in the world.\\n\\nIf you see flaws","by all means","dislike the work for them. Nobody should be demanding that people accept bad work just because it exists","as the art world has always operated on that very notion. AI is no different","it is only...faster.\\n\\nSo","rather than focusing on the notion of \"This is good because it is made by \\\\[Blank\\\\]","it should be \"This is good because it is *good*\".

There is something that is a little different with human-made art that is just more noticeable.  There is a phenomenon with this called the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. In essence","scientifically speaking","the phenomenon is thought to be due to a type of cognitive bias in which the brain prioritizes new information and focuses more attention on it. This can result in the sensation that something has increased in frequency when it actually hasnt.    \\n\\n\\nWhen you pair this with the uncanny valley theory","where they become more appealingbut only up to a certain point. While it is common this theory is used in robotics. However","this also applies to everything Including everything else its more noticeable in things like CGI and art.  Have you ever experienced a movie where you look at the CGI and think... why does this look terrible?  It's because that was shot in 120 frames a second with absolutely perfect geometrics and lighting.  Our brains recognize how perfect it is","too perfect to the point we can instantly tell that its fake and our brains reject it.  \\n\\n\\nHuman art and AI art can be applied as well.  Sometimes when we look at AI art we can notice how perfect it was made.  perfect coloring","line drawing","eye shape","perfectly symmetrical. when we recognize AI art and says it looks cheap.  This is often why.  When you take a look at human art in comparison our brains sometimes see the mistakes and ignore them.  our response to that is that it would look far more appealing to the human eye.   \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day","Art is a preference of choice no matter who makes it.  I value human made art.  But I love AI art because it has given me the tools to make an image that can be used for inspiration for my writing.  \\n\\n\\nNow let's play a small game.  Is this art AI or human-made? and why do you think that?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0wkxyygvfgb1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b777b26937a2b0a9d22586d453725d1daf7ae4e","Totally reasonable.

So AI doesn\\'t really have a net negative in that regard.\\n\\nHe keeps repeating that this is \"free money\" except we don\\'t know how much tread the AI content wheels have since they haven\\'t been around that long. The way YouTubers stay YTers is by staying relevant","can an AI do that without intervention from a human?  \\nIt\\'s also ironic that he\\'s belittling this guy for finding a way to create \\'effortless\\' content when Charlie himself has built his entire career sitting in a chair and just talking to a camera. I know he has done other stuff outside of that like that one go-kart video and he\\'s setup an esports team but the bulk of his work is him just talking alone by himself in a room in his house.\\n\\nThen he features a tweet with that phrase that makes the rounds in anti-AI discussion. The mystical \"HUmaN CoNNeCtiOn\". People will bury their faces in their phones wherever they go to avoid human connection. It\\'s sad how terminally online we\\'ve become that people think their parasocial relationships that they develop with online celebrities equates to a human connection. All the YouTubers and other internet people that have fanbases that equates to tens of thousands to the ones with millions don\\'t know who 99% of their fans are or the fact that they even exist.  \\nWhat\\'s the difference from Mickey Mouse to Mr. Beast? You might have the chance to actually meet the real Mr. Beast and interact with him for five minutes?\\n\\nAs for the arts I\\'d argue the human connection or soul has been stripped out of the likes of movies and music a long time ago. It\\'s all highly corporatized","cookie cutter","focus group tested content made to appeal to the largest group of people. People will make claims about certain music artist being \"industry plants\" or bemoan how all Hollywood generates is sequels and spin-offs.  \\nAI won\\'t make content soulless because it already is.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI think all of us here understand that AI is a tool and we all know one tool is not designed to do every job. AI won\\'t replace most content creators but most of them will probably use it to assist them making content. It\\'s like auto-tune in that musicians will use it to clean up their vocals but they won\\'t put it at full blast to make themselves always sound like a robot and be able to maintain a successful career.

Absolutely","and","sorry","I don\\'t see any problem with that","I will watch it as long as the content is actually good.  And","for those who dislike","I\\'m sure there will always be a demand for those who care about the \"human element","and lastly","those creators who want to express themselves","they will do it","even if you have like","15 people watching it.

If AI generated content isn\\'t flagged as so and they are up to snuff","in the end nobody would care","and no one should say that there\\'s a problem when there\\'s none just to feel morally superior. That\\'s especially true when YouTube is filled with this type of content already (soulless","procedural-generated-by-human stuff","especially the mega-popular ones","possibly among kids).

Nobody shit talks neuro-sama despite that she\\'s almost fully autonomous and those types are probably even more \"problematic\" job-security-wise since once they reached the same level of indistinguishability as actors they can probably be scaled better than them (though that\\'s science fiction for now and will probably stay like this for quite a while).

I mean in 20 or so years when the AI will have reached it's full potential, however good that may be. Maybe it'll be god-like or maybe it won't ever quite be good or reliable enough for most things.\nI'm asking cause I've been seriously down due to all the recent AI 'advancements' for about 18 months now. This is by far the worst depression and dread I have ever felt. I so badly want this to be over, or at least to know how it will end. So I want to see what everyone here thinks. What keeps you optimistic?","comments":["Having a stronger art style and skills while supporting my favourite artists still keeps me on my feet","AI can never replicate the experience of drawing with you homies on drawpile/discord. \\n\\nPlease join a community with likeminded people that genuinely love making art. Heck do it everyday its genuinely a great feeling to be apart community where the common goal is to just to have fun and create cool shit.","I'm not sure this is much","but I look at my passion projects I'm going to adapt into a novel or comic","and even if you set an AI to make a quadrillion stories","that AI is never going to write those stories that I want to tell","ever. The reason AI bros specifically train AI's to imitate artists art styles is because we","artists","have unique styles which AI cannot replicate unless you actively feed our artworks into machines","its the same for every other medium too.","No matter what will happen","I'll just keep drawing bc I like doing it. That's it.","[deleted]","My hpe is that AI companies realize that there is far more money in large language models and such","therefore put all their money in that and create an apocalypse quickly","for everyone","including high-earners","like lawyers and government administrators.\\n\\nif this goes slowly","profession by profession","there will be a significant amount of angry unemployed people long before the situation is so dire for even the top-earners that something like UBI will be considered in public.\\n\\nthat said: I haven't gotten a commission to draw anything for about 6 months","and the last concept art commission I had was fixing up images the producer had made herself with Midjourney.","If digital becomes ravaged to the point of being unusable then I\\'ll switch to traditional only","my clients already prefer it anyways. Same with local expos and art cons","in a lot of spaces traditional has the edge over digital (even though theres absolutely nothing wrong with digital dont get me wrong I love it too). So for a practical solution if you want to have a definitive edge over AI whether you\\'re a hobbyist or a professional","I\\'d simply suggest investing more heavily in your traditional art skills","it\\'s really fun. Go get a sketchbook right now and draw in it every day until its a habit. \\n\\nAnd more importantly for gods sake **stop thinking about it so much**. Now I\\'m not advocating to ignore this issue","plant your head in the ground and go LALALA I CANT HEAR ANYTHING. It is always good to stay informed. But I\\'m telling that to all of you feeling horrible about AI","here. Cut off Reddit","Twitter and the likes","dont go back here if you can help it. It\\'s not worth it. Current social media is arsenic for the soul","it feeds you a bunch of shit you hate on purpose to rile you up","but we keep going back for it like an abusee. It got really bad for me last year until I made the wise decision of blocking all of this and touching grass. Sometimes (like now :) I relapse a bit","something makes me think about all of this bullshit","anger takes over and I feel the urge to gaze at the endless abyss of crazed AIdiocy that seems to have taken over the Internet. All it ever does is waste time and make me feel like an IDIOT. Because I know every word I type will amount to NOTHING. Convince an AI slave to let go of his toy?

Next time you feel the itch to look for horrible AI shit to look into","think about how you\\'re essentially voluntarily sticking your hand in a big jar filled with scorpions. BUT *YOU NEED THAT HAND*. You need it to write and draw and create beautiful things far removed from the machine-made horrors of the current time. Take care of it.\\n\\nThat\\'s just what I\\'d suggest anyways. Focus on your art. Do things the right way","not the easy way. Remember why you are even drawing. I wish you to get better and have fun!! Get that sketchbook now","not later.","Honestly.  I have been coming to terms with not watching any new movies or tv shows and just appreciating the fact that there is plenty of classics I haven't watched or read.    I also do stained glass and ceramics and am pretty happy with those hobbies.   Other then that I am also pretty depressed.....like it actually makes me angry at how AI is just being forced on us","regardless of the negative effects.","The hope that some hacker or saboteur can render generative AIs worthless by messing with their algorithms.","My art practice is a purely selfish endeavor. I have no intention of trying to sell what I make","or even display it.\\n\\nThe things I want to learn from doing art can only be learned by making art. This is","paradoxically","a privileged position. The market disruption caused by AI has no effect on my efforts. It's like my ongoing attempt to learn the math I didn't learn in school (almost all of it)","even though there's nothing I do or want to do that requires knowing a natural logarithm from an integral function. My friends regard this ambition as a charming eccentricity.\\n\\nMy sympathies are entirely with the people who have been working to develop their skills through conscious effort and endless practice. They deserve better than having their work scraped by some cold-eyed techbro who calls himself an 'artist' because he can type BIG TIDDIE ANIME GIRLS into a search bar.","Tbh it's the fact that it's not just artists who are getting screwed over. This stuff is going to fuck with everyone. Writers","actors","programmers","musicians","voice actors","are starting to see it","but there will be many more to come. Public support for the SAG-AFTRA strike is very high. More people will come to our side once they realize what's going on. Things may have to get worse before they get better. Deepfake videos","images","and misinformation will force this stuff into regulation once it starts to influence politics and politicians","Seeing other people being disgusted by it as well. Knowing we are soooo not alone in this. \\n\\nAi wont reach full potential in 20 years if lawsuits resolve. If everything was done legally only in like 80 years or more would we see legal ai thats at this level. Now realistically","all lawsuits wont resolve favourably so the more we push the more it will benefit us and our kids. \\n\\nI dont see a world where its ok to steal intellectual property","basically anything belonging to a person.. their voice or movement or image without extreme compensation for that since its like making a slave out of someone .. stripping them of anything they can use to make an income.. \\nI am hopeful cause i know most people will become wise to this because its logical and right..hopefully they will become wise sooner rather than later. \\n\\n I remain hopeful cause i know most people wont use or consume unethical ai out of solidarity and then fear of being publicly shamed. And im talking about real world people and people with means not these social media degenerates that are spamming platforms. \\n\\nIf and when true ethical ai comes about i will gladly use it in my workflow.. so in like 100 years","Be a better artist","too much people believes that an artist is someone that just make pretty things","but an artist it's much more than that","the artist is a hermeneut","when people talk about the banana with tape on the wall and criticizes it","they do not understand that this piece was made to generate that reaction.

Governments","as stupid as they are","aren\\'t stupid enough not to realize that AI intrinsically \"necessitates\" measures like the C2PA. The C2PA and CAI ARE mass surveillance. More measures like that are for sure coming down the pipeline if the tech gets more sophisticated. Whereas if a serious effort towards a ban is made","it\\'s possible that such mass surveillance measures can be heavily reduced in the long run simply because the \"practical need\" for them won\\'t be anywhere near as high.\\n\\n(Note that I put words like \"need\" in quotes. I don\\'t approve of these measures.

The second AI was made was the second a future without some mass surveillance (even if only temporary) became impossible","and **it\\'s not the fault of anti AI folks","it\\'s the fault of the AI companies and of the hordes of pro AI supporters plugging their ears and shouting down people raising this and other concerns until now","when they can\\'t deny it anymore without incredible levels of dishonesty.**\\n\\nIt\\'s their fault for not even asking themselves the basic question","Huh","if literally everyone has access to technology that can convincingly generate all kinds of information and bypass detection tests","won\\'t that","like","fuck a lot of things like law enforcement up? Wouldn\\'t supporting that tech only make that future more likely","and not less?\"\\n\\nPeople advocating for anti AI legislation are just trying to clean up their mess as much as they can.","I don\\'t think is healthy to think about where this will \"end","it may ever end","life constantly changes and develops","and things don\\'t always get neatly resolved and that be the end of it.

I know I\\'m not alone in wanting to look after our fellow humans. If enough of us look out for each other","perhaps that will be enough","it may not be but we will never know if we don\\'t try.","I\\'m going to repeat what I have said before here","LEAN into the traditional more. It will feel cathartic. AI bros can try to pass off their AI images as \"art\" but they can\\'t pass them off as an oil","acrylic","or watercolor painting. As unjust as it is that digital artists are being impacted by AI like this","we have an alternative that they don\\'t have","can never have (without faking).

I won\\'t lie; I\\'m glad I did","now more than ever.\\n\\nRediscover traditional and learn to glory in it","to relish it. If you\\'ve done mostly digital I realize that getting into traditional will be an adjustment","but one you\\'re well equipped to do.

You don\\'t need a machine to spit out images for you","and doing traditional is the ultimate proof of that.\\n\\nNever give up! We are not alone!","I just try to not think about it and continue working on what I like which is drawing. Cause if I do think about it","I get insanely depressed. IMO human art and art in general will die in the decades to come if things continue the way they're going right now. I just don't think art will survive this and if it does","it might not thrive again in our lifetimes.","Ironically","my money is on the big corporations.\\n\\nWhen","say","Disney sees people using their content and hurting the image of the brand by churning out AI content of their brands","I expect them to take it to court and crack down hard with copyright laws","Knowing that at the end of the day","there were so many artists","writers and musicians before me that went through something similar or way worse yet their passions still kept them going","even if their works were mostly unseen. Hell","there were even people who wanted to hide or burn their paintings and writings for personal reasons and that tells me that art was always a deeply personal thing.

Whoever's reading this","make that story","draw that picture and make that passion project. Remember why you got into art in the first place and keep going.

{"id":"15jrj5v","title":"AI assisted content vs Purely AI content.","content":"Something i've been worried about recently that has only intensified in recent years is what if AI does manage to replace human creativity?\nA human creative can use AI to better their works, but sooner or later it won't matter since a purely AI generated version of that will produce something of equal quality anyway.\nThat doesn't just apply to AI art either.\nShows, movies,  books, videos.\nMost likely before 2030 corporations or even just a few individuals looking to make a profit will just endlessly publish and produce content with AI. And not assisted with AI but just completely made with AI with very little human input.\nAI can only get better and soon it will be of the same quality of any human made work even if heavily assisted by AI.\nI figured at least Youtube personalities would still be human, but recently a youtuber named Kwebbelkop started making fully AI generated lets play videos, and even proclaims himself as an AI influencer.\nHe says (or at least the AI running his twitter) that 99% of influencers, youtubers, and just content creators on the internet in general will be AI generated.\nAnd my biggest fear here is that he is right.\nThere may have been soulless, passionless  mass produced content before, but with AI, people can exploit it to do that as well but still of the same quality.\nEven in an age of corporate, soulless mass produced shit, genuinely inspired creatives that took time still existed and reached an audience of people who could enjoy their authenticity. But was usually because a corporation seeking money and just mass producing stuff to make money couldn't reach that level of quality since they didn't take the time and passion to do so.\nBut with an advanced enough AI that could come eventually, they could replicate it. They could produce something of that quality from it in a matter of seconds and just keep pumping it out. There would be hundreds of masterpieces, millions of movies and shows that were able to replicate that same level of quality.\nAnd back to the topic of Youtube and online content creators, soon there will be millions of channels that flood in that can mass produce high quality content with thousands upon thousands of uploads every day. No one will care. they'll still get the same enjoyment from it that they would get from a video that came from someone who used AI as a way to enhance their creativity rather than take the place of it.\nWho's gonna pay any attention to someone who spends a day to make a high quality video using AI as a tool if they can get the same humor, personality and quality from a channel that just releases thousands of purely AI made content. Cuz that's just gonna be inevitable.\nI don't want that to be the future, I want a future where people with a passion can use AI to enhance their videos and their work. But I'm almost certain that won't be the case.\nEven if someone comes along with a new style or unique sense of humor in general, companies can easily just replicate that and produce videos of the same quality, style and humor at a faster rate.\nI consume a lot of Youtube content. And I'm afraid that sooner or later the creators that I watch will go the route Kwebbelkop did. And I'm afraid that this purely AI content will be the ONLY thing that I can find to watch, and even if there is content that isn't or just claims it isn't, I'm not gonna know right?\nSame thing with shows and games. How will indie developers and filmmakers get their content  out there and have people actually enjoy it when they are absolutely drowned out by millions of purely AI shows and games that have the same quality as the things they make.\nThis reality has just been really depressing me. I've noticed that I've already lost a lot of energy just thinking and stressing about this future (if anything good has come out of this, it has certainly fixed my sleep schedule lol). I guess I'll have to buckle and just accept and consume the content since I won't have much of a choice. But before that happens I've just been left horrified and afraid for this.\nAt first I thought I was afraid of mass produce stale content. but I realized no, if that were the case people who have passion about what they do will create stuff of value.\nI'm just afraid that passion... won't really mean anything anymore. Since the same beauty and quality that passion can derive can be replicated and mass produced.\nThanks for reading my rant.\n&#x200B;","comments":["On a philosophical level","I wonder what the difference between human creativity and the illusion of creativity is.

{"id":"15jyqer","title":"An AI Artist's Honest Take on AI Art","content":"I'm an AI Artist. I make art with AI assistance.\nAI art is not the sort of art that just turns out nice. In fact, neither is traditional art, but I'll get to that... Rather, AI art is the sort of art that usually turns out very badly, as drawn by someone with good technique and terrible anatomy.\nIn order to get a piece of AI art to not piss off a traditional artist, you have to literally look at and think about every part of the image you get and decide how much you care about that part being as wrong as it inevitably is, and be willing to invest at least a half hour MORE worth of work for every such feature, often much more still. I say MORE because doing this on an image usually eats at least an hour, and sometimes you discover even more stuff later.\nThe first big problem I have with AI Art as a whole, however, is that *too many people who post their output don't do that work*.\nAI Artists are NOT alone in this regard, however when someone is executing more steps more manually this can be understood: one step of a hundred over 30 hours is easier to overlook, and understand having done badly; it may not be something the artist even knows they are bad at. Nonetheless, when you don't have those 30 other steps you have to do, doing the steps that remain are all that more significant. This means the bar MUST be held higher for AI art. Then, too often I see traditional artists also shitting up an art site because they don't want to have to learn.\nSecondly, and again this is NOT unique to AI Artists, there is a major problem of excessive attention seeking. I am reminded of when a popular artist in a particular genre was invited to an online group I am in. They were encouraged to leave after about a day of nonstop shitposting. Whenever someone else posted any other art, they would unleash a torrent of more of their own, art, mostly porn.\nAI art feels the same way, and as an AI artist, that feels especially shitty. Like, I post about as often as my husband, a traditional artist, posts WIPs. I know part of it is that urge, that need to get that hit of \"look at this thing I did,\" and I think *everyone deserves to occasionally feel that, when they contribute meaningfully*, to have a place they can celebrate and be celebrated. But right now? Folks need to stop shitposting it up.\nIt should be stated that AI artists are joined by traditional artists in all of these problematic behaviors, but much like a foot race, the shorter you run for your event, the faster and harder you are expected to run. \nFor us the bar of conduct and output is just that much higher, like it or not, and currently theres not enough open, top level discussion about this, especially among us AI artists. I think this warrants community introspection.\nEdit: I know these are things that most of you know. I cannot be alone here in these frustrations, and it would be narcissistic to think that I am. But while we point this out in AIWars or wherever else Artistic Haters are posting, there is very little spotlight put on these issues by our community within our community. Being able to admit our flaws as a community makes us more able to defend our strengths and processes, and makes us vigilant to keep toxic behaviors properly moderated.","comments":["It also strikes me that this is the solution to the AI art culture war: by making it a pillar of our community that we are as AI artists against low effort content and spam","it allows us to make it clear that *we are not about engaging in the low-effort content spam they rail about*. It places their real enemy outside of us.","I really like this post. It mirrors my own feelings on the matter pretty well! I tend to spend multiple hours on a single piece","and consider raw outputs to be like any raw material. It's good for shitposts or inspiration","but nearly always has too many weird flaws to consider a polished piece of art. It makes me kind of sad that the AI art community focuses so much on prompts and so little on the rest of the artistic process.","This is a fair take","i love this opinion. to add i also think it makes art so much more efficient. you edited an ai generated art for an hour for something that would take 15+ hours if done by hand. i just dont understand why they are so against it being quick.","> there is a major problem of excessive attention seeking. \\n\\nOh hell yes.

The community just needs to work on the pipelines and something like an inbuilt OpenPose pass or a model where every character image was supplied with an OpenPose would resolve distorted proportions or missing limbs.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t want shit AI art everywhere and we\\'re not going to be able to stop people generating it then the best objective is to identify the flaws in AI art and start on projects to fix them.\\n\\nThen we\\'ll have good AI art everywhere","which is at least a step up."],"created_utc":1691351362,"timestamp":1736366835,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.11950425170068028","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.175","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.20821428571428574","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.07948717948717947","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.06822916666666666","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.7","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.4444444444444444","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.09375","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.07083333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.13333333333333328","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.125","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.00833333333333334","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.19983766233766231","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.32857142857142857","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.3","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"}]}

{"id":"15k2t1e","title":"Generative AI in Art: Embracing the Future Beyond Traditionalism","content":"\nIn the diverse world of art, there's a new medium capturing attention: generative AI, particularly in the realm of text-to-image transformations. It promises to reshape how artists interpret and depict ideas, yet faces resistance from traditionalist factions within the art community. However, is it fair for traditional artists to pressurize publishers into sidelining artists who utilize these avant-garde tools?\n1. Broadening the Horizon of Creativity\nGenerative AI offers artists an expansive playground to visualize concepts. By converting text descriptions into intricate images, artists can realize abstract ideas with precision, merging human creativity with AI's computational prowess. The resultant artwork can sometimes be beyond the scope of traditional techniques, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression.\n2. Ethical Training Sources: Addressing the Concerns\nA significant criticism of generative AI is the potentially ethically questionable sources used for training. However, many tools have taken conscientious routes, using ethical databases and transparent methodologies. By doing so, they ensure that the art produced isn't just innovative but also ethically sound. \n3. Leveling the Playing Field\nIt's pivotal to understand that generative AI isn't about replacing artists but enhancing their capabilities. By yielding to pressures from traditional artists, publishers deny new artists a platform to showcase their work, essentially curbing an entire subgenre of art. Art, historically, has always been about inclusivity and diversity of expression. Sidelining generative AI artists would contradict this ethos.\n4. The Evolution of Artistic Tools\nAcross history, artists have always employed tools – from rudimentary brushes to digital tablets. Generative AI is merely the latest addition to this lineage. Just as the transition from hand painting to digital art was met with skepticism, so is the transition to generative AI. However, over time, each tool found its place, enhancing rather than diminishing the art world.\n5. Economic and Accessibility Implications\nGenerative AI democratizes art creation. Not every budding artist can afford a studio or expensive materials, but with AI tools, they can still bring their visions to life. Moreover, these tools can often be more economical for publishers, offering high-quality artwork at a fraction of the cost, broadening opportunities for both artists and publishers. But the greatest advantage offered is one that using traditional art methodologies cannot easily provide by itself  - the ability to rapidly create custom illustrative content on demand. (See NVidia Perfusion and Adobe Firefly)\nConclusion\nThe debate surrounding generative AI in art is emblematic of the larger discourse on the role of technology in creative fields. While caution and ethical considerations are paramount, it's essential to distinguish between valid concerns and resistance to change. Publishers and the broader art community need to recognize the transformative potential of generative AI, ensuring that innovation and tradition can coexist harmoniously in the vibrant tapestry of art.","comments":["To me it comes down to the fact that GenAI is itself a potential media.\\n\\nInstead of the art being an image  the art can be a set of 10 well annotated character images from all angles showing all relevant details.\\n\\nInstead of the art being a show","it can be a model trained not merely on the scenes the producer/editor decided we're good enough","but the output of a model trained on all those scenes with their scripts and tagging of all additional information which is then used to produce even more scenes of real humans acting for a physical camera for whatever additional content they decide is necessary.\\n\\nNow instead of doing a wrap on a single movie","you wrap on a whole model","a whole system of movies.\\n\\nThe problem of excessive traditionalism is that it doesn't JUST turn away from useful tools","but that it turns away from whole useful products."],"created_utc":1691361321,"timestamp":1736366658,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.170269770879527","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.08148148148148147","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.31666666666666665","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.12571428571428572","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.08333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"}]}

{"id":"15l8rnu","title":"AI IS NOT A TOOL. IT MAKES CREATIVE DECISIONS","content":"So many people on here responded to my last post on here saying that AI is just a tool and it’s still the humans making the art at the end but No thats not the case. \n\nLet me ask you a hypothetical: if you’re friend showed you a piece of art they commissioned from an artist online who would you credit as the artist? Them or the person they hired to make the art? Now obviously they had input. They came up with the idea or “prompt” for the artist to work with. The artist may have even shown them different versions so the person could makes changes of add specifics to their prompt. But the artist is still the one making the picture who is ultimately going to make many creative decisions about what the picture will look like in the end. \n\nIn fact no matter how many words I say to the artist or how specific I am I ultimately cannot beam what is in my head into the artist head and have them make exactly that. The artist is going to have to interpret the idea and make their own creative decisions any way you slice it. YOU WOULD NEVER CALL THAT ARTIST A “TOOL” YOU WOULD CALL THEM THE ARTIST. AI LITTERALLY DOES THE SAME THING EXCEPT THROUGH MECHANICS INSTEAD OF GEUINE HUMAN THOUGHT AND EMOTION. THIS IS WHY I DON’T LIKE AI ART. IT IS NOT MADE BY HUMAN ARTISTS AND THEREFORE NOT COMMUNICATING A HUMAN EXPERIENCE. You can disagree with me about not liking AI and honestly depending what it is you value in art I can at least understand that perspective. BUT PLEASE STOP SAYING AI ART IS A TOOL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nEdit: a lot of people have made the argument that someone using AI can be an artist through editing the image themselves similar to how a photographer is an artist. I admit it’s not a bad argument and there probably is some truth to that. I still argue it’s a different kind of art than what people who draw/paint themselves do though. And if you’re looking at an AI image there is no way to tell how much of it was the actual artist and how much was the AI.","comments":["I think you don\\'t know the tech enought","I agree with some points you\\'ve made tho. Let me explain :\\n\\n**In the case of full prompting output** (usually hobbyists - someone who only type text to generate an image) it\\'s somewhat true that it\\'s less a tool and more like a generate machine until you\\'re happy.\\n\\n**BUT the tech evolved a lot the past 6 months.**\\n\\nYou now have controlnet","adetailler","you haves loras that are mini-models to fine-tune your vision","etc","which enables professional artists / already established artists to include A.I as a TOOL. YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY. AS A TOOL. They don\\'t rely on full prompting image","they can pinpoint exactly what they want and make their vision more sharper with realistic materials.\\n\\nMy best example is one of my closest friend which is working for the videogame industry as an artist for the past decade","I\\'ve always been blown away by the realism she and her team could output. They use *Photobashing techniques*. Photobash basically means that you get photos \"bashed\" on top of the 3D model. For example","she was doing a Destroyed Store images for one survival games","she created the 3D layout","textured it and applied some photos here and there with photoshop to make it more realistic.\\n\\nSo","how does A.I is integrated into a workflow like that theses days ? Instead of endless searching on Google images for endless hours for the perfect photo in the right angle","she now have the power of using controlnet to generate WHAT she needs","in a photorealistic ways.\\n\\nShe still use her taste","her layout skills","her compositions skills","her trained eyes and everything that she used before. It\\'s just that it accelerate the way you can **create realism**. This is clearly a tool to me","because before that","theses type of artists used photo references","now they can generate photorealistic references and spend less time of making thing realistic by overpainting for hours.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s what I\\'ve always been saying","the real winners of this tech are still established / professional artists who just power-level their abilities to create realism but still with their sharp vision / trained eyes. So no","in many usercase","now it doesn\\'t make creative decisions. The user does.","Ok first of all","calm down.\\n\\nSecondly","it's a spectrum. You can literally leave the prompt blank and generate a completely random image","or you can use tools and extensions to **decide** virtually everything (composition/pose/colors/lighting/style/medium) etc etc. That's not to mention people using outputs for reference/inspiration and either adding on top or creating from scratch","modeling in 3D/drawing before moving to AI for refinement","inpainting selective areas","using AI strictly for upscaling etc etc.\\n\\nYour insistence on imposing absolutes here isn't helpful. It's not black and white.","There are two different kinds of ways of making art: Constructing and capturing.\\n\\nConstructive art starts with a blank canvas and uses tools to create something from scratch. Think of composing music","painting","drawing","sculpting...\\n\\nCapturative art starts from a thing that can be captured and then refined from creative choices. This is where photography falls on. This is where music covers also fall. This is where AI art falls.\\n\\nThe reality of art is that it\\'s a subjective descriptor borne out of encyclopedism during the enlightenment - an obsession with defining everything. Previous to this","art was considered a science","or part of religious rituals","or historical folklore. The idea that there\\'s something that is \"art\" is very recent in the grand scheme of things","and there\\'s no good answer or final conclusion. No one can really tell \"what\\'s art\" because it\\'s a human invention","but we can only look at what\\'s widely considered to be art.\\n\\nSo photography went through a long period where it wasn\\'t considered an art form - It simply captures what the camera could see","and [this made many art critics angry](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/o/obriene/art109/readings/11%20baudelaire%20photography.htm). A human did not spend a long time studying anatomy or the behavior of light in order to get a photograph. And yet","you can make many artistic choices with photography","you can choose lenses","or select subjects","or modify exposures and techniques","but today even the most [spontaneous photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candid_photography) is considered an art form","which a lot of times involves very little control from the photographer. Sometimes","having little control *is* the point. This also happens with constructive art","like in the case of Pollock\\'s drip paint (Which a lot of people still hate)","which is based on a random process that he believed helped bring out his subconscious mind.\\n\\nAI art","as a capturative art form","is seen as an [exploration of the latent space that makes a model.](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/07/generative-ai-space-and-the-mental-imagery-of-alien-minds/) Some of that exploration is random and lazy","sometimes with the purpose of a quick sense of reward of seeing what comes out","sometimes with a functional purpose like getting a stock image to put on top of an article. Sometimes","that exploration can involve more detailed artistic choices. So you have simple choices like samplers or classifier free guidance","and then you have more complex choices","like inpainting or outpainting. Or LoRAs or Dreambooth to maintain consistency of subjects. Or ControlNet for pose control. [There\\'s a guy on the Stable Diffusion subreddit who\\'s famous for putting his own image in historical contexts.](https://youtu.be/K0ldxCh3cnI) There are [short films](https://youtu.be/hkwtIN4xpwc) and [fictional movie trailers.](https://youtu.be/LodDJFg_LQk) The intention of making any of this didn\\'t come from a machine - On the end of the scale","it\\'s both a capturative and constructive process.\\n\\nSo there\\'s no reason to think it\\'s not a tool","and that the people using it are not artists. The model has no goals and no intention of creating anything","similar to how a camera doesn\\'t go out and captures masterpieces by itself. If the result is kitschy and boring","or if it\\'s creative and interesting","the responsibility falls entirely on the hands of the human author","not on the machine.

Ai the way it is now is a criminal and perverts dream.\\n( If you dislike ai and maybe dont appreciate the amount of stupid responses you are getting visit artisthate sub where anti ai people are discussing the issue.. aiwars is overwhelmed with ...)","didn't read","Is this like the one-drop rule for AI? If even 1% of the art involved AI","it's all AI-generated and the human involvement has to be ignored?","Under normal circumstances","I probably wouldn't think of my friend as any more of an artist than they were before telling me that they commissioned art.\\n\\nHowever","as another commenter mentioned","it's a spectrum. If they added context that their pitch for this commission was paragraphs long and that they considered dozens of concepts","(while it sounds like a nightmare for the artists involved) I would begin to think of them as at least a creative contributor to a larger artistic work. If that friend then showed me a rough sketch that roughly corresponded to the layout of the final product and said that he sent it to the artist for reference","that would be yet another major step toward them being an artist in my mind.\\n\\nIn both the hypothetical scenario of my friend commissioning an art piece","and the analog of a friend creating AI art","the resulting art is a collaboration between both parties. The reason that we call AI a tool rather than crediting it as the artist is merely an issue of sentience/humanity. While AI art is impressive","AI is not remotely close to the point of rivaling human sentience. In your original hypothetical","there are two entities making creative decisions. My friend and the artist. However","when someone uses AI","while the software can similarly take over a portion of the creative legwork","as it is not a sentient being we can not credit it with making creative decisions; thus the term artist seems inappropriate.\\n\\nAs it stands","image generators are non-sentient software that humans can use to massively increase the speed at which they can accomplish certain goals. That seems like the textbook definition of a tool.\\n\\nObviously","AI artists are making less creative decisions per piece than traditional artists","I don't think anyone would contend otherwise. However","as the sentient entity making the most creative decisions relating to a given piece I think it makes the most sense to credit the human behind the AI art as the artist. That's not to say that they're equally skillful as a traditional artist","only that their creative decisions led to the resulting image.\\n\\nI feel like if we actually think about the complexity of creative decisions that we feel are sufficient from people before we consider them to be artists it's not usually that high. If a guy throws paint at a canvas","the resulting mess is his creative output","despite the fact that he merely flung his arms and let gravity control the intricate details. Despite this difference in impact though we wouldnt consider that artist to be a tool for gravity","as it is ultimately his creative will that is being executed","as hes the only sentient being involved.  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR  \\nart is a spectrum","if ai is not a tool than what is it?","As humans create new tools","it would only make sense for them to eventually make decisions for themselves.","My artist doesn't use AI to completely generate an entire image. She will take parts objects","eyes and such to add into her own art. Then again she started off as a digital artist so I would assume she's doing the exact same thing she used to do with stock. With AI this speeds up the process for her drastically. I'd consider that a tool.\\n\\nHell","even if its fully generated art. It still has to go through a person's stamp of approval and their prompts to generate the art. Otherwise you would get some really scuff and weird looking art.","So what? Art isnt all about getting credit. This is all from the pov of servicing the artists ego. The pov so many artists arent acknowledging us the pov of the art appreciator. A tool that makes a picture exist that is nice to look at that didnt exist before is a good thing. Period. And if a pic can exist that the only other way it could exist is id someone spent years training and they couldnt bc of other obligations","that is a good thing.","I wrote a Python program","that through logic","makes creative decisions. It\\'s still just a tool","and so is a LLM. Probability and statistics isn\\'t \"creative decisions\" it\\'s probability and statistical...","How do you define tool? In this context I go with: \"an element of a computer program (such as a graphics application) that activates and controls a particular function\". \\nDefinition 2b\\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tool\\n\\nAn AI isn\\'t a person. It is an object to be used for a function.","I agree","it absolutely makes creative decisions. But that doesn\\'t make it not a tool.\\n\\nBut i also can see the sentiment in calling the AI or even whatever specific model is being used an \"artist\" on its own","precisely because it makes those decisions and has \"preferences\" on its own.\\n\\nBut that still doesn\\'t make it not a tool. But the argument is honestly semantics at this point. It is an tool like you could call an assistant artist (think comic assistants","people doing gruntwork in animation) a tool despite them being a unique human with their own skills and opinions. The difference is just that you would never call another human being a tool. But this isn\\'t a human being.","I play with all different types of AI to make things and the other day while I was playing with midjourney I had the thought that the prompts I give it were just as creative as a poem","or if you aren\\'t ok with that were at least as creative as a cooking recipe. Would you call a recipe art","probably not","but creative absolutely","and if someone uses a cake mix where they just add water and an egg and can still consider it cooking","well hand crafting a prompt and curating the final image is just as much art as that is cooking. \\n\\nI\\'m also reminded of making collages out of scraps of magazines","the only real artistry is in my curation and putting it together","this would still count as art","and I honestly think I\\'m giving more direction to the prompting than the collaging process. Similarly photobashing is often used for concept art","and that\\'s almost the same as collaging but in photoshop and sometimes with a bit of painting over it make it blend in better","but again the curation is more the point of creativity than any skill to make it. Then there is also photographry or maybe and even better example would be video editing","you can completely change what a movie is and how it feels by changing the edit","what get\\'s left in","what get\\'s removed","what is next to what will completly change the meaning (I\\'m reminded of the hitchcock expirament where he showed something like an image of a nearly smiling man","one was after somthing like a cake","the other after an image of a pretty girl","changed the meaning completly using the same image). \\n\\nAlso I used to be a graphic designer","when I started I thought it was dumb that we didn\\'t create everything we used from scratch","we didn\\'t use our own fonts","sometimes would use clipart or brushes","often a lot of what we did was more organizational","or remixing than anything I would consider making something","and I struggled with that for a long time","I think a lot of designers do","we go into these jobs because we like being creative but then often we find that the job is more to be someone who pushes buttons and moves things around more than someone who \"creates\". I\\'ve since made peace with it","and once read the equivalent of \"we are all paid to push buttons","but sometimes it\\'s less buttons than others\" AI art is like that","our role is more in curation and organiztion than creation","but that can still be art."],"created_utc":1691472910,"timestamp":1736366799,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.19285714285714287","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.07619047619047618","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.22499999999999998","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.3333333333333333","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.2589285714285714","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.10000000000000002","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.05833333333333335","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.375","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.30000000000000004","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.041666666666666664","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.16666666666666669","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.16666666666666666","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.03749999999999999","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.037500000000000006","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.21250000000000002","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.41666666666666663","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.55","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.24375000000000002","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.1875","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.8","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"-0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.375","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.3333333333333333","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.32666666666666666","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.1","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.22000000000000003","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.5","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.5","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.025","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.7","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.16995959595959595","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.6666666666666666","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.4","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"-0.0625","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.05000000000000001","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.16666666666666666","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.5","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"-0.051851851851851864","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.4","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.125","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.10833333333333332","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.05","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.6","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.15625","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.21428571428571427","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.1","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.08333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.3333333333333333","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.3333333333333333","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.19444444444444445","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.07777777777777775","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.5","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.08333333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.3","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.3208333333333333","sentiment":"NEGATIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","se

{"id":"15mw4x2","title":"I asked CHAT GPT How to Reason with an artist who is an AI hater","content":"Absolutely, approaching such a sensitive topic requires understanding and empathy. Here's how I'd approach the conversation:\n1. **Acknowledge Their Concerns**: Start by acknowledging that technological advancements can indeed be disruptive, especially in fields deeply rooted in human creativity like art. It's natural to feel protective of one's craft.\n2. **AI as a Tool**: Explain that AI, especially generative AI, isn't inherently \"creative\". It's a tool, much like a paintbrush or a camera. It doesn't create art out of a sense of passion, emotion, or life experience like humans do. Instead, it generates based on patterns it's learned. Many artists use tools to enhance or evolve their art, and AI can be seen in a similar light.\n3. **Uniqueness of Human Experience**: While AI can replicate styles or patterns, it can't replicate the unique human experiences, emotions, and stories that artists bring to their work. That intrinsic human touch is irreplaceable. \n4. **Collaboration**: Some artists have started collaborating with AI to discover new styles or enhance their work. It can be a way to push boundaries or overcome creative blocks. Instead of viewing AI as competition, it can be viewed as a collaborator.\n5. **New Opportunities**: Historically, technological advancements have often led to new artistic avenues and opportunities. For instance, the invention of the camera was initially seen as a threat to painters, but it eventually gave birth to the field of photography.\n6. **Preservation and Respect**: Assure them that while AI can replicate styles, it's essential for people to understand and respect copyright laws and the intellectual property rights of artists. We should be vigilant against misuse.\n7. **Economic Concerns**: Address the concern about job losses by highlighting that while AI may change the way certain tasks are done, it often creates new opportunities. Artists can differentiate themselves by emphasizing their unique vision, providing art lessons, or venturing into new mediums.\nEnd by emphasizing that art is about connection, emotion, and storytelling. It's a reflection of the human experience. While AI can generate patterns, it will never capture the soul and essence of true human creativity.","comments":["Most of these points where brought up already and it doesn't really make a difference","cause their arguing in bad faith for the most part.","You think a calm","rational discussion with radical activists is possible?\\nThey don't care","they don't want rational debate.

{"id":"15n6ynf","title":"the Impact of AI on Jobs and Industries","content":"In the realm of today's quickly advancing technology, a common concern lingers the idea that AI might lead to job losses as machines take over tasks previously performed by a person.While it's true that AI can indeed streamline and automate tasks that once required human effort, it's crucial to recognize that AI also holds the potential to guide in new job roles and industries.\n\nThink of AI as a tool that can both simplify certain tasks and stimulate fresh opportunities. Just like when photography were introduced, some jobs may evolve or shift, but new a opportunity will likely open up. this cycle of change is a characteristic of technological progress, bringing with it a mix of challenges and possibilities.\n\nThe key lies in how we navigate this evolving landscape. By being proactive and preparing for these changes, we can harness AI's advantages while minimizing its potential downsides. Instead of being passive observers, we have the chance to steer the course of AI integration to align with our needs and values.\n\nIn essence, the impact of AI on jobs isn't a one-way street toward job loss. It's a multidirectional journey where we play a crucial role. As we stand at this crossroads, let's embrace the potential that AI offers and embark on this exciting new phase fully equipped. By doing so, we can make AI work in our favor and embrace the positive transformations it can bring to us\n\nI know it's difficult for some to accept change, but embracing new technology will benefit everyone in a long run","comments":["It sound like a feel good answer","Im using AI to not be behind","but this is the first tool that directly replace a medium. \\n\\nPhotography wasnt meant to replace realistic drawing","it wasnt the attention.
