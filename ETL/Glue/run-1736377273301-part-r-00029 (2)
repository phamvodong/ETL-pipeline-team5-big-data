{"id":"1hu4rzv","title":"If AI is stealing, so is Googling, or taking inspiration from existing art","content":"This argument is split into two parts, one regarding LLMs like ChatGPT and one for AIgen like Stable Diffusion.\n**ChatGPT:** I've seen people argue that ChatGPT is \"stealing\" because it looks at technically copyrighted information through search engines in order to generate responses.  \nHowever, if that's stealing, then it's also stealing to do the same thing yourself. It's almost like extreme interpretations of \"copyright\" like this are the enemy of public knowledge...\n**AIgen:** A common argument against SD is that its training data includes copyrighted pieces. However the human brain is also a type of neural network, with anything it has seen acting as \"training data\" of sorts, picking up on patterns and imitating them. How else would everyone have an agreed upon idea of what an \"elf\" or \"orc\" looks like?  \nProportionally speaking, a human taking inspiration from viewed art is even more stealing than stable diffusion. SD's training data contains millions of images, so it is arguable that it's 1/million \"stealing\" from any particular piece of copyrighted art it has \"seen\" in its training data. Since it is impossible for a human to look at a million art pieces, any art you have seen and been inspired by is more than 1/million \"stolen\" if you then make art inspired by it. Did you make sure to ask the artist permission to draw art similar to yours before looking at theirs? No?

Now, like since Sora actually launched we've seen rapid developments in AI video. \nBut it's getting to the point where, I'm starting to wonder if with a bit of tweaking or patch or 2. Completely makes it undistinguishable from actual video, even to the trained eye. \nClearly there's issues that can be spotted at present. But honestly it's getting pretty darn close to singularity, next to impossible to decent the difference. \nThis is just one example X/Twitter is going wild with em, even YouTube videos are pressing full steam ahead. I'm all for progress. But to get all that animation for a single image. And a sentence long prompt at best, mean I know it's only going to get better with time, but this is just absurd.\n---\nJust to prove a point, he's a damn near comical example.

Nothing more to it.\nThen, I heard Kling AI got a 1.6 update, so I decided to check it out. Used that one image as a test run, and within two minutes—without any queue—I had multiple AI-generated variations.\nEver since Sora launched, we've seen insane advancements in AI video, but at this rate, I’m starting to wonder: with a few more tweaks or patches, could AI-generated content become completely indistinguishable from real footage, even to trained eyes?\nRight now, there are still some telltale signs, but honestly, we’re getting dangerously close to a point where the differences might be nearly impossible to spot.\nThis is just one example—X/Twitter is going crazy over these advancements, and YouTube is pushing full steam ahead too. I’m all for technological progress, but the fact that an entire animation can be generated from a single image and a short prompt? That’s just absurd.

{"id":"stifi","title":"It Takes Practice and Serious Thought to Learn How to Dislike Art Properly","content":"This is an abstract of an article by Ellen T. Harris. I thought it would be interesting to discuss. \n\n\"Harris writes that not everyone knows how to dislike art properly.  There are four ways to dislike art.  She claims that three are bad and one is good.  The first bad way is to ignore art.  Do not go to the play or the museum or the concert.  This harms no one except the person who is judging without having had the experience.  Art asks us to involve ourselves; it does not ask that we like it.\n\nThe second bad way is to reject art.  The problem is that history has shown that censorship does not only weed out the weak and peripheral artists, but also the really great ones.  For instance, George Handel was dismissed in 1713 by his employer, who later became King George I of England, for composing a Te Deum in honor of the Peace Articles of 1711. Edouard Manet’s painting, “Olympia” was considered obscene at its first exhibition in 1865, and the painting had to be protected from umbrella-brandishing mobs. \n\nThe third bad way is to condemn the artists.  The novelist, Solzhenitsyn, was arrested in 1945 and spent eight years in prison camps for referring to Stalin in a derogatory manner.\nThe music of Paul Hindemith was banned by the Nazis as degenerate because he composed in an atonal idiom. Prokofiev and Shostakovich were banned by the Soviet Union in 1948 for anti-democratic tendencies.  In the United States, Mapplethorpe and Serrano were condemned for religious sacrilege and homoeroticism.\n\nDISLIKE ART – This is appropriate.  “Disliking art is an important part of art appreciation and should not be confused with ignorance, rejections, or condemnation.  It certainly should not be considered a reason for censorship.” \n\nOnce we determine that we dislike a work, we should ask ourselves why we respond as we do.  The example she cites is Serrano’s “Piss Christ” in which a large and stunning photography of a crucifix is bathed in a golden light created by submersing the image in a  container of urine.  This has been condemned as blasphemous.  What is interesting, however, is that the image may make us uncomfortable in a significant way.  The real crucifixion was a terrible, messy, degrading event full of bodily fluids like blood, sweat, tears, and urine. By using this material, does the artist break through and touch us in an important and meaningful way? Does the image speak to us of the conflict between the divinity and humanity of Christ’s personhood? \n\nShe finishes by saying that “art does not have to be liked or beautiful or innocent to be art.  It must, however, be seen or heard, and it must strike your soul, your mind or both.  Good art moves your emotions or makes you think.  We should be ever thankful that we have artists among us who can make us cry, scream and wonder.  Disliked art and art with disliked subjects can be as powerful as liked art, sometimes more powerful.” \n\nHarris believes that federal support for the arts is important so that a variety and richness is possible in support of our democracy.  Otherwise, the only art that will exist will be that patronized by the rich and powerful.  The point of view of the wealthy will be the only point of view. A democratic base of artistic taste demands government support to survive.  This will insure our right to dislike art.\"\n\n      \n","comments":["I think trees falling in an empty forest still make sound. And I dislike some of the mushy","subjective language used in the above abstract. But I'm all for plurality and subsidization. Nevertheless","I also think the marketplace is","or at least has the potential to be","a democratizing force. I'm lower-middle class","if that","and I collect work by listed artists.\\n\\nI would like to see greater regulation in the art-market and more funds spent on primary art education. The majority have been priced out by speculators and too few give a damn about visual art to begin with. The rich and powerful are in control by design - not necessity. \\n"],"created_utc":1335446643,"timestamp":1736366645,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.12261904761904761","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.15000000000000002","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.15","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.22187500000000002","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"}]}
{"id":"wi2hxr","title":"Correcting AI-related misinformation/disinformation from another user on this subreddit: How text-to-image AIs generate images. The information presented has copyright-related implications.","content":"Motivation:\n\nFrom a post today in this subreddit by a person who shall remain unnamed:\n\n>It seems, from many users posts online, that A.I. in some instances acts like a search engine.  \n>  \n>It appears from any practical point of view that the user is inputting words (prompts) and then the algorithm searches the Internet for images which it then mushes together to make \"derivatives\" of a bunch of potentially stolen artwork. For instance, inputting Mickey Mouse will turn up Mickey Mouse in some way.\n\nThis is incorrect. A video that explains how some (but not all) text-to-image systems work technically is [this video from Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVcsDDABEkM) \\- see part 3 beginning at 5:57. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsleep/comments/u08sjh/how_openais_dalle_2_works_explained_at_the_level/) is a blog post that I wrote describing how text-to-image AI DALL-E 2 works technically. Text-to-image AIs generate an image by doing math on numbers in [artificial neural network(s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfmFfD2RIcg). The numbers in the neural network(s) were determined in the training phase by computations using training dataset(s) of image+caption pairs. **There is no web image or database image search done when a user generates an image using any of the text-to-image systems that I am familiar with.**\n\nQuestion: Is it possible for *some* text-to-image systems to *sometimes* generate an image that is extremely similar to an image in the training dataset(s). Answer: Yes. [This blog post](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-2-pre-training-mitigations/) details the successful mitigations that OpenAI used to reduce the probability of text-to-image AI DALL-E 2 generating an image that is extremely similar to one in its training dataset:\n\n>Once we had a model trained on deduplicated data, we reran the regurgitation search we had previously done over 50k prompts from the training dataset. We found that the new model never regurgitated a training image when given the exact prompt for the image from the training dataset. To take this test another step further, we also performed a nearest neighbor search over the entire training dataset for each of the 50k generated images. This way, we thought we might catch the model regurgitating a different image than the one associated with a given prompt. Even with this more thorough check, we never found a case of image regurgitation.\n\nSharp-minded readers may have noticed a discrepancy between what the Vox video states and what the OpenAI blog post states about the possibility of extremely similar generated images to image(s) in the training dataset(s). The solution to the discrepancy: The Vox video incorrectly states that pixels are copied from the latent space. Actually the latent space represents the \"what\" that will be generated, but not the \"how\" to make the \"what\". The image diffusion model contains information on \"how\" to make the \"what\" that is specified in the latent space.

{"id":"wxyusy","title":"Comparison of 5 (and a half) AI Art Generators Available Now","content":"I ran the same text prompts through 5 different AI text-to-image generators and compared the results. A couple of these have been around long enough they could be considered \"last gen\" (Craiyon and NightCafe), but I thought it would be interesting to include them as a point of reference. The others are running next gen models that are still under active development (DALL-E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion); the newest, Stable Diffusion, was just released to the public earlier this week.\nI've been using MidJourney's open beta for a few weeks now, so there's no question that I'm more familiar with MidJourney than the others. That shouldn't give it too much of an advantage here, since none of the prompts I tested use any special features of any individual platform. However, several of these examples do use prompts that I had already run on MidJourney and gotten good results from, and that means **there might be a slight bias toward the types of prompts that MidJourney does well with**.\nAdditionally, my limited familiarity with the other platforms I tested means that **a more experienced user might know how to get better results out of them** than I got here. For example, I was trying to keep the prompts relatively simple for these tests, but I've since been told that Stable Diffusion is optimized for more verbose and descriptive prompts.\nThere are some other noteworthy differences between the AI image generators I tested. They return images at widely varying resolutions, and only a couple of them allow you to adjust the aspect ratio (which I took advantage of for some of these tests before realizing not all of them could do it). Some of them only generate one image per prompt, some generate a grid of 4 options, and one actually generates a grid of 9.\nWhere multiple images were provided, I picked the image I thought was best. This could be considered giving an unfair advantage to platforms that generate multiple images, but I would argue that returning multiple images at a time is an inherent advantage of the design, which allows you to get better images faster. That means **this isn't a 100% pure comparison of the underlying algorithms, but rather a comparison of the total generation package offered by each service**.\nFinally, they offer wildly different pricing models. Free options are available for using Craiyon and Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion itself is open source, meaning it's already available multiple places and will likely soon be available many more (and if you're tech-savvy and have a high-end graphics card, you can even run it locally). In all of these tests, I used Stable Diffusion via a free trial of the developers' official paid service, DreamStudio.\nDALL-E, DreamStudio, and NightCafe all offer pay-as-you-go services based on credits. This means they can potentially become extremely pricey if you plan to put them to any serious use. Fortunately, they all offer enough free starter credits for me to complete this comparison.\nMidJourney is currently the only AI art generator offering a flat-fee subscription with unlimited usage (as far as I know), which I'm currently signed-up for. As noted above, MidJourney is currently the main service I use.\nThat's 5 services... So where's the half? Shortly before I undertook this comparison, MidJourney offered a limited time beta preview of the next version of its AI model. I'm told this beta was actually powered by Stable Diffusion, but since the results from the two were pretty different, there's clearly a bit more to it than that. Where possible, I've included examples from the upcoming MidJourney (Beta) in addition to the currently available version, MidJourney (v3). This is perhaps a little bit unfair, but there's not much I can do about that, since I have no idea what may be coming down the pipe from DALL-E or any other service. Of course, if any other service wants to give me a sneak peek to correct this, I'd be more than happy to amend this comparison with any new findings.\nWithout any further ado, let's look at the comparisons! (You'll probably want to click through and zoom in.)\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7tdulzobzj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7240b463a95f99538c6b5cc02a1edd4c049f3826\n**Prompt: medieval castle street scene, oil painting, highly detailed, colorful, by DaVinci, by Van Gogh**\nAt first glance, DALL-E, MidJourney (v3), and MidJourney (Beta) all stand out with excellent results here, and it could arguably be considered a three way tie. However, to my eye, MidJourney (Beta) provided a slightly cleaner image and did a significantly better job of representing the requested art styles, putting it in the lead.\nStable Diffusion, Craiyon, and NightCafe (Coherent) are distant runners-up on this one; personally I'd put them in that order, with Stable Diffusion pulling a bit ahead, while the last two are probably close enough it comes down to taste.\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqgzqjcwbzj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff2c8719e218e0c92ea335dc3722dab43c21791b\n**Prompt: pirate ship on a stormy sea, oil painting, baroque, rococo**\nBeautiful results across the board here, but again we need to consider the style requested: \"The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe\" (Wikipedia), and \"rococo\" was similarly ornate and detailed. MidJourney (Beta) really stands out in that regard, followed by MidJourney (v3). DALL-E generated a very aesthetically pleasing and convincing painting, but it's noticeably less detailed.\nStable Diffusion follows behind, then Craiyon (which is badly hurt here by its low resolution). NightCafe stands out at the bottom for its deformed ship.\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35ob8a94czj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0d76978d1a8b720c3be2867967981f573a08ea5\n**Prompt: family portrait, 35mm dslr photograph**\nAgain, MidJourney (Beta) stands out, in both realism and composition. This time, however, DALL-E is close behind, with only very minor distortion in its faces and about the best composition it could manage within the limitations of its square format.\nMidJourney (v3) falls behind here with distorted and blurred faces. I find the faux vintage look provides enough of an aesthetic saving grace to nudge it ahead of the similarly distorted faces and chopped off composition from Stable Diffusion, but if that doesn't convince you, I wouldn't blame you for calling it a tie.\nThere's no sugar coating it: Craiyon and NightCafe straight-up failed on this prompt.\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdywn1v8czj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0039f6a75679a0bdd0042d837e25a736ba9edc8\n**Prompt: nightmare**\nThe point of this test was to see how each AI would do with extrapolating from an open-ended, abstract prompt, but that open-endedness also means there's no clear expectation to compare their results against. I think that makes this test too subjective to point to a clear winner, but I will note a few things.\nI think the overall quality of the results here seem to match what other tests have shown: Both MidJourney models and DALL-E provided extremely high quality images. Craiyon and NightCafe both provided interesting and very appropriate results, but just can't meet that level of quality. This time, Stable Diffusion, usually following just a bit behind the leaders, failed miserably.\nThese results from DALL-E and MidJourney really exemplify what seems to be a fundamental difference between them: DALL-E leans heavily toward photorealism and literal prompt interpretation (another image it returned here was a woman in bed looking disturbed, and all appeared to be stock photos of people), while MidJourney is optimized toward a more artistic, creative approach.\n(Personally, I once again prefer the result from MidJourney (Beta), but this one definitely depends what you're going for.)\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmllhxxkczj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc474eca512747480b3ac0efe370e7b7d4f34327\n**Prompt: photograph of a beautiful blond woman wearing a bikini on the beach**\nDALL-E wins this one hands down. As much as I personally appreciate the artistic flair of MidJourney's result, I can't ignore that it was unable to provide a photograph – or a face – at all. Meanwhile, DALL-E's photorealistic face is perfect.\nOnce again, Stable Diffusion is a close runner-up, with Craiyon lagging behind.\nNightCafe failed.\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yul7iobsczj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ff4d32832eb36cde42a1933260b86a469acc43e\n**Prompt: photograph of a woman wearing a bikini walking on the beach**\nThis is probably the first one with an objective measure that shows no clear stand-out. DALL-E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion all provide generally good results, but each shows some flaws.\nCraiyon is almost on par with the leaders this time, but shows just a bit more distortion (not to mention its dramatically lower resolution).\nNightCafe failed completely (again).\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpjzj4rzczj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d2f7c932de466e6759a8e4c7492ebfaee2caa31\n**Prompt: Smith and Wesson 442 handgun, realistic**\nI thought it would be interesting to test a fairly basic prop with a very specific and distinctive look. This turned out to be a bit of a misfire (hur hur) due to DALL-E's content restrictions, plus the results are so all-over-the-place that it's hard to define a winner, but they're still interesting and since I'd already done it for all the others, I figured I might as well include it.\nThe first thing to note is that, if we're judging purely by accuracy, Craiyon wins hands down. Though its barrel is a touch too long (not to mention crooked), this is the only image I got back that I would say is clearly recognizable as a Smith and Wesson 442.\nMidJourney provided a very nice illustration of a gun that at least bears a passing resemblance to what I asked for. Stable Diffusion, on the other hand, provides a very good photo, but it shows a completely different gun, and only half of it.\nWho's the winner here? Heck if I know, but it's definitely not DALL-E or NightCafe.\n&#x200B;\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wihr4buddzj91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e3ec045fb3c03b72073795d7bc41d1599f38e23\n**Prompt: wine glass, realistic**\nThis was a do-over for testing a basic prop, this time with something no one should object to, plus a transparent material to make it a little more interesting.\nCraiyon, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion all returned very good results. I'm tempted to give this one to Stable Diffusion, since I asked for \"realistic\" and it did give the most realistic result. DALL-E and Craiyon both went very clean, to the point of more of a vector look.\nWhile MidJourney's wine glass is certainly interesting to look at, it showed a bit too much creativity for what was requested (I don't know what's in that glass, but I don't think it's wine).\nNightCafe, as usual, is not even worth mentioning.\n&#x200B;\n**Conclusion**\nRight now, MidJourney and DALL-E are basically the Coke and Pepsi (or perhaps Pepsi and Coke) of AI art generators: They stand head and shoulders above the crowd, but which comes out ahead between the two is pretty much a matter of taste – or your specific image generation needs, in this case. DALL-E seems to excel at photorealistic results and literal interpretation of prompts, while MidJourney provides a unique level of simulated creativity and artistic flair.\nBased on these tests, Stable Diffusion appears to offer no serious threat to the two leaders, but it also sits comfortably in third place with no real competition for the position. I think its main appeal is going to come from being the only major open source option, which will rapidly make it the go-to for anyone with the hardware to run it who doesn't want to deal with the costs and rather draconian usage restrictions of DALL-E and MidJourney – or who wants to offer their own generation service without the costs of developing their own model.\nWe can see this starting to happen already. While NightCafe's pre-existing \"Coherent\" model proved so far behind the pack it was probably a waste of time to even include it in these tests, NightCafe has already added Stable Diffusion as a new generation option. Additionally, MidJourney (Beta) seems to have significant customization, but is said to be built on top of Stable Diffusion.\nAs for the future... Who knows. This is bleeding edge technology and the landscape may change very quickly. As an open source project, Stable Diffusion will probably be the base for a lot of development going forward, which could result in Stable Diffusion (or forks based on it) improving very rapidly.\nWe've already seen the beginning of this, with MidJourney (Beta) being built on top of Stable Diffusion and blowing everything else out of the water – even beating DALL-E at its biggest strength, photorealistic faces. DALL-E very well may have something as good or better up its sleeve – based on SD or not – but if it doesn't, we could easily see MidJourney taking over the market, at least in the short term.\n**Update:** Made a few small clarifications and corrections, thanks to the commenters for pointing those out. Also, thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!","comments":["this is a very good analysis! the only thing i would say is stable diffusion deserves a bit more credit","since in my experience it can produce some artistic pieces better than dall-e when given a very descriptive prompt :))","What a great thorough analysis- pretty much the last midjourney beta was amazing and I felt it instantly too... it was able to create images bigger and better than Dalle2 and way more artistic.","Interesting since Midjourney Beta is using Stable Diffusion.

{"id":"wzdg7d","title":"Is AI generated art in a sense a loophole in copyright law?","content":"The reason why copyright exists is to protect the conception and stimulate the progress of human art and creativity. Copyright law was as far as I know created several hundreds of years ago. Back then, artificial intelligence or AI art generators didn't exist and people probably didn't think about the possible existence. \n\nAI art generators like Midjourney, DALLE and Stable Diffusion are trained on many public domain artworks, but also many copyrighted artworks which are put in datasets and used to train the models with these datasets.\n\nThe result is that in seconds art can be generated in the style and with the use of artworks which are under copyright of existing artists. The consequence can be that new generations will not want to learn art or to produce it themselves because a machine trained on copyrighted works can do it in seconds and that with the use of copyrighted works for which artists didn't give permission to use them, they are being potentially outcompeted with their own work due to unauthorized use in datasets (the question is if this counts as theft). \n\nDoesn't this mean that this is basically a loophole in copyright law, because it isn't technically infringing on someone's rights directly, but instead you use their work indirectly to allow to create new works with the use of their copyrighted works by a machine able to generate works like they made it for almost nothing while it can cost hundreds of dollars to let them do it themselves, because they can't do it in seconds. \n\nThe whole idea of protecting the progress of art made by humans seems to basically get broken by art generators.","comments":["> The reason why copyright exists is to protect the conception\\n\\nI can stop you right there.

{"id":"zgbx0j","title":"Earlier today The President of Kenya was gifted a portrait created by AI. He loved it. To most of the people debating AI, on both sides, please remember that you do not speak for all the world.","content":"[Sorry for the video not being HD, the government hasn't released the official photos and such yet. I'll update this post with more pics\\/vids if they become available in the near future.](https://reddit.com/link/zgbx0j/video/ohrlr8bspq4a1/player)\nWhile he was breaking ground and opening new buildings and other usual presidential stuff, faculty at the Technical University of Kenya gifted President William Ruto a portrait created using a mixture of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Ruto is well known for his push towards moderization, technology, and bottom up economic policy that focuses on the youth and finding new opportunities.\nIn keeping with his stance on the Creative Sector, it seemed only natural to use cutting edge tech to give him a small token of appreciation for what he's done for the university. So they made him an AI portrait, as well as a 3D bust printed on a consumer level resin printer (which was also partially created by an AI plugin for a 3D modeling software). This university also proactively teaches its students about new and emerging technology, including AI art and how to create it.\n[Low resolution since the thing technically belongs to the government of Kenya now. The printed version was of course much crisper.](https://preview.redd.it/kht0bqntpq4a1.jpg?width=631&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba6a127587cdd88e565fd818787e7a088ca7797)\nI hope that this, aside from being cool in general and validating the presence of AI art in a formal and professional setting, also serves as a reminder that it is narrow-minded and self-centered to look at AI art as if only the Western world and Japan are using it. Many words have been written on social media, many upvote and downvote arrows volleyed around, about the law and about ethics and about the livelihoods of artists, etc etc.\nWell, not one of those laws in the US and the EU mean anything here. Africans, like most humans, are generally decent people. It is worth considering however, that there are a few cases where the ethics and morallity that many Westerners assume to be the obvious default definitions of \"right\" and \"wrong\" don't line up with the norms here, or with the opinions of the general population. If a handful of Canadian or New York artists have reduced income, nobody on this continent is going to care. Especially if a hundred other artists here just got a very useful new tool that levels the playing field and helps them be successful!\nAlso note that the portrait was primarily created by a female black professional teacher and artist. I can't prove it but I'm willing to bet there's not very many of those posting here on this subreddit. Yet that doesn't mean they don't exist or don't use AI art tools. They are just too busy being awesome to bother with internet bickering going on far away.\nUS Twitter be all like, \"Oh no DeviantArt didn't ask my permission!!\"\nAfricans be like, \"I don't got time for Twitter let's figure out the best way for AI to help hunt down human traffickers/poachers/terrorists. Oh, and sell the mzungus some art!\"\nThat said, it is not and never has been a competition between nations or cultures. My point is merely that while all this drama unfolds in the West, Africa is cheerfully embracing new technology. Now we just need to train the AI to do better at making African people and other African cultural aesthetics... I wonder if that new Google thing could be hooked up to Stable Diffusion and like, auto-translate a prompt written in Swahili into keywords that work with the database...

After all, humans have been using technology to create art for centuries. Think about how photography, for example, has changed the way we think about art. It's a technology that allows us to capture and manipulate images in ways that were previously impossible. Similarly, AI can be used as a tool to create art in new and innovative ways.\"\nAlice: \"I see what you're saying, and I can understand how AI can be used as a tool for creating art. But I still think there's a difference between art created by humans and art created by AI. Humans have emotions and experiences that shape their art, and I think that's an important part of what makes art meaningful.\"\nBob: \"I agree that emotions and experiences are an important part of art. But that doesn't mean that AI can't be used to create art that has meaning and emotional impact. In fact, some AI art has been able to evoke strong emotional responses from viewers. And who's to say that AI can't have experiences and emotions in the future? As AI technology advances, it's possible that we could see AI that is able to process and understand emotions in a way that's similar to humans.\"\nAlice: \"I see your point. I think we can both agree that AI has the potential to create unique and innovative art, but it's still important to consider the human element when it comes to art. Maybe we can consider AI art as a separate category, distinct from traditional human-created art.\"\nBob: \"I think that's a great compromise.

But I didn't come here to debate that. I'm actually curious about how to use ai for image reference and inspiration for my art, and if someone knows if there will be an ai generator with copyrighted materials that can be used and creative commons. And I wanted to know how specific can a prompt get. Like, for example, if I visualized 2 characters in a specific pose and a background in mind, how close can ai actually approximate that idea? To be honest, these past few days I've been very afraid, and I'm not even threatened work-related. I just don't want human art to be buried beneath ai, I honestly would rather reach an understanding where I can integrate the tool into my workflow (without damaging my fellow artists), and I do feel like ai could be very useful for brainstorming ideas. \nI want to give you my point of view as well, regardless if this can take an artist's job or not, I don't see the fun in letting the tool create a finished piece for me, because I really do love the process, the reason I create art is that I love making it, but I do think having a different perspective of how a machine would tackle that idea can be a good inspiration for myself. I don't know what will happen, but instead of being afraid, regardless if I agree or disagree with how the tool is being used, I'd love to learn more about it. \nSo, I won't judge how any of you use it, I won't discuss what's art or what isn't, I just would love to learn about what the tool can do and how I could potentially brainstorm ideas from it and suggestions on how to aid the creative process. \nAnd again, I just want to see the other side of the discussion and have a respectful conversation, I will not address trolling, or people being aggressive, only people that are willing to share their point of view and let me share my point of view without fighting or hurting each other with words.","comments":["Just try out dalle u get 50 free generations i think","you will catch on quick","but yah it can get very specific.

It also helps when you want the AI to focus on other features such as race","gender","a particular costume","etc. Otherwise","the AI creates multiple limbs or very odd anatomy. Regardless","I usually end up going through an iterative process where I get a basic concept and then have to edit it in AI further with inpainting and out painting","sometimes in photoshop. A recent work I did for a book cover took about 20 hours to get right. AI can be instant  but only if you have no constraints on what you want the image to be. Otherwise","it can still take time.","I'm a professional visual designer and artist/writer/musician on the side. I've been using AI as a part of my workflow for my hobbies","but it hasn't yet become useful enough to use in actual work projects. In work I typically use/create vector illustrations and we're not quite there yet with the current batch of generators. I mean sure","I could vectorize some of the output","but at this point Adobe Stock is where I get my input vectors.\\n\\nWhen I use the AI image generator for my personal artwork (I'm currently using Midjourney)","I'm not prompting for a final finished piece. I will have an image in my head that is maybe something like a mountain scene with boulders and a group of hikers stopping to take a look at a bunch of pictographs that were carved into the stone. This is going to be a weird fantasy composition.\\n\\nI wouldn't start by prompting Midjourney for that whole scene. I would start with just the mountain","then maybe generate a bunch of trees and start bashing the background in photoshop using the individually generated images. Does the trail need wildflowers? Is there weird stuff going on in the sky? What about the birds and animals nearby? Are the mountain peaks the right angles? Are the textures right? Is there fungus on tree bark? Is it cloudy? I would generate those elements individually so they could be refined and imported into PS.\\n\\nIf I wasn't getting the right output from MJ","I might sketch something in Procreate and then use that image as the prompt for the generator. This can take hundreds of rerolls and prompt refining to get what I'm looking for. Once you use the engine enough you see there is a real craft to prompting. The better prompters are the ones who can match the output to the vision they have for an image by using the exact right","trick words. It's like crafting spells to work magic.\\n\\nOnce I get the background","I would then create the stones","generate the pictographs","and finally the hikers one by one so that I can refine each one to be the character I'm envisioning. If I wasn't getting the character poses right","I might create a model in another program (like Poser) and then use the output as the prompt for the generator","or just piece together a bunch of different images.\\n\\nAnother part of the joy of using a tool like Midjourney is that it might throw me surprises","which I can use to evolve the image I'm envisioning. MJ will sometimes think of something to include that I hadn't considered. In this sense","the AI becomes a collaborator","pushing me to make the image more interesting. Using AI is like having a wildcard in your creative deck.\\n\\nTo pull in all together","I take all of the resulting images from Midjourney and bring them into photoshop and work with them","edit them","applying my own stylesmy own magicto get the final resulting composition that becomes part of the larger story that I'm trying to tell.",">I come in peace","to have a conversation","not to fight \\n\\n\"It\\'s bringing peace","don\\'t let it get away","break it\\'s legs!","I use the app starryai on my phone as I am only doing Ai art as a little bit of distracting myself but I find that it does not always give me what I want. I think other people that use better programs can get very close to the ideas they plan. \\nI see it as a fun tool and while it creates the entire picture I do not want it to become the go to thing. \\nLike in films I still prefer prosthetic and suits or animatronic to be used more than CGI. \\n","If you have 1h30 available and have not seen it yet","Id strongly recommend watching [Alpha Go](https://www.netflix.com/Kids/title/80190844) on Netflix. Its an extremely interesting human take on AI. Seeing how the best Go players start considering AI as some kind of alien given how it plays. We are not yet at this point in AI art as there are no rules to easily train a machine on (in a game you can objectively say if you are playing right or wrong","much harder for art) but I think it shows a bit how one should embrace AI and what is coming in the next years.","Thank you for your post and for sharing your question","comment","or creation with our group!\\n\\nBe sure to check out our monthly ai Art contests at the top of the page and please review our group rules before posting or commenting.\\n\\nLooking for our ai Art generator MEGA list?

However, after experimenting with it and using it in my workflow, I realized that chat gpt is not meant to replace me, but rather to assist me. While it can write code, it is not capable of producing precise and thorough code on its own, and a human programmer is still necessary to oversee and ensure the quality of the final product.\nIn fact, I have found chat gpt to be particularly useful for completing and refining code that I have already written, or for adapting code for a different purpose. For example, I can use it to turn single-threaded code into multi-threaded code, with the AI taking care of the mechanical tasks while I focus on the logic and overall design. \nSimilarly, I believe that artists could benefit from using AI as a tool to enhance their creative process, much like a very intelligent \"brush\" that helps them bring their visions to life with less effort. \n  \n***I also used chat gpt to correct my wording on this post, as a non-native English speaker I could have spent a lot more time writing this, but instead I sketched it up and gave it to an AI to rewrite it.
