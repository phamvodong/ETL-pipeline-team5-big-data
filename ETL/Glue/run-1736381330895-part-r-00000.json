{"id":"101dwc0","title":"5 Arguments to defend AI Art, Written by AI","content":"\"There are a few arguments that could be made in favor of the use of AI in art:\n1. AI can be a tool for artists: Some artists may see AI as a tool that can help them create new and interesting works of art. For example, an artist might use an AI algorithm to generate ideas or inspiration for a piece of art.\n2. AI can create unique and original works: It is possible for AI algorithms to create truly original works of art that are unlike anything that has been created before. This could be seen as a positive development, as it could lead to the creation of new and innovative forms of art.\n3. AI can democratize art: AI technology is becoming more accessible, which means that it is possible for anyone to create AI art. This could be seen as a way to democratize the art world, making it more inclusive and diverse.\n4. AI can be used for educational purposes: AI algorithms can be used to teach people about art and how it is created. This could be a valuable resource for educators, students, and anyone interested in learning more about art.\n5. AI can be used for therapeutic purposes: Some people have suggested that AI art could be used as a form of therapy, helping people to express their emotions and cope with difficult feelings.\nIt is important to recognize that these are just a few of the potential arguments in favor of the use of AI in art, and that there are likely to be other perspectives as well. It is important to consider all sides of the issue in order to come to a balanced understanding of the role that AI can play in the art world.\"\nI took the transcript of [SamDoesArt's Anti AI Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Viy3Cu3DLk) using a [chatGPT youtube video summary extension](https://glasp.co/youtube-summary), and then wrote \"give me counter arguments\". As simple as that.","comments":["1. So can Google? I don\\'t know","for years and years people have been doing just fine drawing inspiration from other places. From life","from nature","from the world around them. AI can\\'t give you an idea because you yourself need to have an idea in order for the computer to construct something based out of it. It is not much help against burnout if you still need to know what to type in the tool in order to get something out of it.\\n2. It cannot. It is strictly against the nature of AI to be able to create something original","it quite literally works by receiving input and making something out of it","in this case other people\\'s artwork. Computers are unable to generate something out of nowhere because they are unable to express themselves creatively unlike a human mind.\\n3. No? Do you think every artist is someone with three $1000 monitors in front of them drawing on their $5000 computer with a 4K tablet that costed another $1000? Or someone that spent literally thousands of dollars on paint brushes and canvases? We started doing art by rubbing powder on a wall. People still do this","for less than 20 bucks you can get yourself a pretty decent drawing notebook and a pencil and start creating. I really don\\'t get where this notion of \"AI can democratize art\" comes from when you literally need to pay to access it and pay people to type on a keyboard for you?\\n4. So can people. Fact","that\\'s how we have been doing it for generations. You can literally just go to YouTube and have access to thousands of tutorials and classes about art right now. A computer can\\'t teach you about expression for it has none. Art is not an objective thing...\\n5. So can just... Doing it yourself? In fact","I do not believe for a second that waiting for a computer to make an image for me would ever give me the same satisfaction that actually creating something would.\\n\\nI think a lot of people in this sub need to understand that making art is not and never was about making photo-realistic depictions of real life or at least create awe-inspiring masterpieces on a canvas. Art is about expression","you just need to be comfortable doing it and do it yourself. Why would you ever want to remove the soul","the creativeness of it is really beyond me and trust me I really tried to understand what is the mentality behind it.","Point 4 doesn't really make any sense","Art id already something everyone can do","even the people without eyes and hands","even dogs can make art with their mouths. The algorithms that generate images do not facilitate the first steps to making art","in fact what they really do is make people convince themselves that they're actually making art and hampering the creation of new artists across the world.","[removed]"],"created_utc":1672669738,"timestamp":1736366657,"content_sentiment":{"score":"0.20096153846153847","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},"comments_sentiment":[{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.14583333333333334","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25833333333333336","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.12083333333333333","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.1125","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.14285714285714285","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"-0.019999999999999997","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.4","sentiment":"POSITIVE"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.2","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.25","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.11212121212121212","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"},{"score":"0.0","sentiment":"NEUTRAL"}]}

I'm practically no one considering AI has already replace us.\nMy Dad would be very devastated that I gave up on my talent, but once I go visit his grave I'll tell him why I'm quitting.","comments":["This is sort of like if someone bulldozed your house and you got mad at bulldozers. Capitalism is the problem here","and it is the reason all automation is used to harm the working class instead of benefiting us.","AI is not going to stop you from making art people will enjoy. AI will reduce the work it takes for people to make art. In other words","by being a more productive tool","artists can do more with less. This is a good thing. It means our demands for labor can be met faster and cheaper. As with all technological advancements","this will impact existing job markets and some people will be out of work. This is not a new story by any means. It also shouldnt be a reason we shouldnt have AI art. \\n\\nAs an example","There are plenty of communities based entirely on fossil fuels to be their local economy. They will be negatively impacted by clean energy technology such as solar panels. However","this does not mean the technology itself is bad. It means we need to socially find ways to support people whose skills have been automated.\\n\\nYour art is not being taken away from you. If you choose to publicly display your art","you cannot blame people for using it as experience and inspiration for future projects. Youre the one who put it out there to influence people and communicate something new to them. As long as theyre not blatantly copying your work for personal commercial purposes","its fair for them to do whatever they want with it.\\n\\nSorry but I dont see how youve made any meaningful objection to AI art here. Your artistic skills and identity are still real things you have. Youre not stopped from producing art and sharing it. Youre just confronting the age old idea that not all skills are market-relevant forever. People in creative disciplines tend to feel theyre better than people in other disciplines and above this kind of automation","and its quite a humbling identity crisis theyre facing now.",">I\\'ve seen some of my favorite artists leave because of this and it impacts me mentally\\n\\nThis is the most important part of this","and it isn\\'t about AI art.  It is about a culture of fear and an imagination focused on negative possibilities.  \\n\\nYour feelings are valid","and they are a reflection of the media you are consuming and the negative feedback loop it is promoting.  You can see this in your writing:\\n\\n>I\\'ve been seeing ... I heard .. all the talk ... all the talk .. I\\'ve seen ... to think about ... wrap my head around ... to think about ... being told\\n\\nThis shows how much what you are seeing is affecting your mental state","driving you to find more negative information in a repetitious loop.\\n\\nMy recommendation has nothing to do with AI art","because it is the object of your fears","not the source of them.  The controversy could over something else with no changes to how devastating it feels; it would feel no better to see artists complain or quit in response to massive outsourcing to Malaysia or the Philippines.  \\n\\nTake a step back and imagine a post you might make in that world.  \\n\\n>Over a past few weeks I\\'ve been seeing news articles about outsourcers potentially stealing from artists and replacing them in the process.\\n\\n>Then I heard more information about artists being taunted by Techbros and being told \"Your art is so useless outsourcers are probably better art then what you\\'ve created.\"\\n\\nFeels artificial","doesn\\'t it?  It you feel like you can take a step away from that","you can take a step away from what is affecting you now.  You need more distance from a negative ecosystem that runs on provoking your reactions.  You are being goaded into negative","repetition thinking.","What are your opinions on washing machines","Here are my 3 considerations.\\n\\n1) AI is not preventing you from creating art (illustrating","painting","etc..). You can just **ignore** this technology and keep doing what you love doing. AI might make it harder for some artists to make money with art. But then we are **talking about money**. Not art. That is the thing with so many criticism regarding this technology","they have nothing do with the technology itself","they are just: well","how do we deal with the fallout? As many people have said: artists don't hate AI art","artists hate the current economic system and its shortcomings. Also","many people do things without hoping to make money with that given thing or skill","it is worth to highlight.\\n\\n2) You can adapt","and incorporate AI into your workflow. Automation will come for all of us and eventually there will be probably a need for society to discuss some sort of UBI in the future","but until then","the name of THE game be a step ahead. AI still can't do anything a human can","so you learn how to do what the machine can't do yet.\\n\\n3) And sorry if might sound a little harsh but: The world doesn't own anyone to keep an industry alive just so that people can do what they like doing. For instance","I'm sure there are people who like doing a bunch of things that sometime there is simply no way for them to make money with that thing  there is no industry that would pay for them to do that. \\n\\nIt just doesn't make any sense to artificially keep an industry alive just so that people have money when there is a machine that can do the same more efficient. It would make more sense to advocate for **UBI** instead.","Found this post looking for something else","but wow","I'm sorry","man. I'm a creative writer myself and I feel you. A big chunk of the problem with AI being used like this is the financial stuff","sure","but there's another big chunk that's about how AI is being used as a replacement for humanity in the creative process... and how disturbing it is to just surrender that to something mimicking real people. \\n\\nIt's also heart wrenching to see all the years of hard work you put into learning your craft be so heavily discounted and disrespected. Not to mention how demoralizing it is to know there's a machine out there that can immitate your style potentially","something unique to you as a person.\\n\\nLike","I've been writing for a long time and made the decision to give it a real shot a few years ago and to try being a novelist","but looking at AI now makes me feel like I wasted over a decade of my life.  \\n\\nThe people in this post really","really didn't understand what I feel like you were saying","and I'm sorry that all you got was stuff about money and 'adapt or die'. It just feels like most people want a 'magic art machine' to try making a quick buck/get instant gratification and don't really care about anything else.\\n\\nAnyways","just wanted to say I feel you and I share in your disheartenment. I do hope that things get better though... Maybe people will come to feel that consuming things made by AI art isn't as satisfying as art made my real people.","Ok just wow.  As a technologists and an art lover I can tell you that ai is just a tool.  The secret sauce will always be the one being the tool.  And for all the bells and whistles ai programming is a best mimicking creativity and at worst outright stealing and remixing existing works by human artists. Ive been testing different tools https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTLesNu1f/ and its far from the art killer people are making it out to be.  Because it lacks your doubts","your fears and anxiety that fuel you to greater achievements.  Just one mans opinion","> My Dad would be very devastated that I gave up on my talent","but once I go to his grave I'll tell him why I'm quitting. \\n\\nClearly you are superstitious and need the assistance of a mental health professional.\\n\\nDon't blame AI art for your bad brain. Get the help you need and grow up.","Those who taunt you that your art is useless and that you will be replaced are fucking morons who neither understand artificial intelligence nor the creative spirit.  \\n\\nEventually","humanity will need to address the issue of non-human life and whether we will treat them as equals or property.  Eventually.  I don't see the technology getting to that point for at least 40-50 years","and the debate on legal personhood for synthetic lifeforms will likely take another century beyond that.  Consider that for the most part we don't even treat all humans as equals.  Then there's the whole controversy which will bring a cataclysm to the religious world... oof!  That's going to make the controversy of automating parts of professions a non-issue despite how incendiary the topic is today.\\n\\nYou are more than your technical skills.  Read that a couple of more times and let it sink in.  \\n\\nProfessions are based on a set of identified skills that society values based on the products or services that an artisan provides.  The value is externally based and will always change with advances in technology in every profession.  I cannot think of any profession that has remained static since its inception","can you?\\n\\nHowever","our passions are based on our internal valuation.\\n\\nI point this out because while we can sometimes get very lucky and explore our passions in our profession","such will not always be the case.  But even if we are lucky and can combine our profession and passions","we run the risk that our passions will get dulled because of how the requirements of the profession wear on us.  Been there","done that.  Nothing kills passion faster than having it bastardized to meet the wants of society so that we can put food on the table.  Also","that makes situations such as the one you are in so difficult.  The passions that are part of who we are become muddled with what we do to the point that we have difficulty separating the two.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence tools will not eliminate craftsmen and artisans","although their numbers in different professions will decrease.  The masters of the craft will continue to prosper and probably see their value to society increase.  Some of the more middle-tier artisans will leverage their ability to connect with people to carve out their own niches - some using the new technologies","some not.  The less talented will be faced with a choice between learning and growing or finding new professions that may or may not be tangential to their old professions.  \\n\\nThe hard truth is that no one is entitled to the profession of their choosing at least until we can get to the point where we have a universal basic income.  Another hard truth is that disruption is an agent of change and growth.  Without it we become complacent and stagnant.\\n\\nYour feelings are valid","and I hope you take the time to work through them.","im all for reducing ai \"art\" to raw ideas and nothing more","ai images should only be used for scientists and researchers and doctors","nobody else. ai text is the only useful thing for everyone.","You are not against AI art. You are against capitalism.\\n\\nYour maom concern is your value in a capital system. And that others will gain from your hard work. That i completely understand.\\n\\nAs a artist like yourself. I already made a few bucks selling AI art. and i see many ways it will speed up some processes at my job. But as artists in this given age we have to be quick to adapt.\\n\\nAI gives me the option to finish pieces i wouldnt otherwise have time for with a full time job. Just like 3D softwares. is something that many artists had to pick up and learn as well.","You are against assholes","not ai. Just think about it.","You are a deranged narcissist","get help.","The reason why you feel depressed is because of very established and popular artist have poisoned the well","with art-pocalyptic rhetoric. There is no \"end of art\" (I\\'m looking at you Zapata) in sight. You might chose to use AI","or you might chose not to use","that is up to you. What we (the pro-AI) are disgusted by","is the fact that influential people try to stigmatize AI-image generators","and the victims of that stigma *are precisely the artist that are not that known*. Look at the debacle in r/Art","where lesser known traditional artists were bullied and banned by the mods","even after they provided evidence of their AI-less workflow.\\n\\nNo one is going to replace the artists. Yes","it will chance the play field","maybe dramatically","but you will still be able to do what you like most. Will it be sufficient for living only from art? In reality","it *never was*","only for the very few lucky. There is a strong sample bias and survivor bias in this field","but people forget that it\\'s a discipline where only few are really successful at becoming famous enough. Is the same for people that get into sports dreaming one day to be like someone who is now in the spotlight","or at least near","but if you realistically count the number of people that are there and compare it to the ones that dedicates years to get there","the results are really depressing.\\n\\nI know that sadly I\\'m not helping the mood with what I said in the last paragraph","but the truth is there was never a paradise for art out there stolen by the evil AI.","These folks would all be singing a different tune if their job was on the chopping block.   Everyone talks about just 'going to another job","that is easier said than done.","I wonder what would happen if we just shut down all forms of creatives period.

{"id":"104pnq8","title":"A short explanation on why AI art isn't stolen","content":"Most AI art uses diffusion/GAN for training. That is, there are two seperate AIs. \nOne AI actually generates the images. It does so by starting out with random pixel noise and then gradually 'resolving' the pixel noise into an image in several iterations. We will call this AI the 'generator'. Without any training, the end result of this AI would simply be random pixels.\nThe second AI tries to tell if a given image is generated by the AI or if it's art from the dataset. We will call this AI the 'discriminator'.\nIn the training process, the both AIs basically build each other up. The generative network gets feedback from the discriminator. When the discriminator finds out that an image is generated, the artificial neurons of the generator are corrected. Through a complex mathematical process known as backpropagation, we are able to find out which neurons are to blame for the insufficient result and correct them. Similairly the discriminator gets feedback from the code that performs the training. Whenever the discriminator lets the AI get away with an image, its neurons get adjusted.\nThe product of this training process is the generative model. In this whole training process, it has never once, directly or indirectly, gotten access to any images by artists. In conclusion, the AI has independently learned how to make art, and the art generated by it is not in any way stolen or 'mashed together' as many artists like to say","comments":["They don\\'t call it stealing because their art/artstyle is incorporated into the final products","it\\'s because their art is used as part of the training process **without their consent**. It shouldn\\'t matter why they don\\'t want the art in the AI system (personally I don\\'t see any reason to withhold your art from the training)","they should still be able to consent or not consent to it\\'s use for that purpose. That\\'s what I see a lot of other pro-AI people get wrong.  \\n\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean \"death to the AI art industry!\" or \"all AI models inherently steal!\". It\\'s that some artists just don\\'t want to contribute their work. And that\\'s OK! We can (and will) survive without them.

Admittedly, it’s a very high-level perspective rather than trying to argue over disputed details, but I’m curious what both sides think of this since I’d like to develop it further.\n\n1. AI art opponents seek to use copyright--intellectual property rights--to prevent progress for their own economic benefit, but the overarching purpose of copyright is to promote progress, not hinder it or stop it.

To get a precedent, an artist would need to bring a strong lawsuit and likely get it up to the Supreme Court, which would take years. For reference, the recent Goldsmith v.

Most people have cameras in their cellphones that are powered by advanced technologies using AI to enhance the quality and ease of use.

Its less dystopian than is is freeing us to be individually able to express ourselves better than we ever could in our lives. \\n\\n4. AI spam is unavoidable. People are going to be proud of what they produced. The novelty might wear off and they could settle down. Itll probably happen for a while. Whether its good or bad depends. Some people are annoyed at the bias is reveals in the people making images. Some people are annoyed at the bias it reveals in the data. Its up to you to tune out what you dont care about. \\n\\n5. In time","very little of what humans can do will be beyond what an AI can do. AI is not great at stable animations or 3D art. Its not great at music or coherent and emotional storytelling. It will be trained to do all this and more. Its probably many more years from actually being able to do all the artistic things people can than some would like to believe. An artist working on their art career right now","should practice their craft and be a great artist AND should learn to use AI as a powerful tool","AI art doesnt have a goal","its just a thing that now exists in the world. Art wont be gone","but the ability of everyone to make art will change what we define art to be; I think its going to effect culture deeply and change industries. It sucks for artists who have a great deal of technical skill to see that suddenly everyone can produce high quality works","but we are about to see this happen across many types of skill sets. Its only dystopian if its not distributed to everyone","and it really is just a new tool. Real artists doing conceptual work will make new things with it","1. AI doesn't have a goal","it's a tool like anything else. (For now","talk to me again when it asks 'why am I here' in ten years)\\n2.

Cause value is not an objective metric but rather assigned on an individual basis (the valuer) with the market being a somewhat more stable averaging of those individual valuing processes. Humans value context. Thus there will always be place for professional artists","even those that work without tie to anything ai related. No matter the time or dystopian growth of ai.

As the impact economic things hold on the art theatre lessens.","Concisely:\\n\\n1. No.\\n2. No.\\n3. No.\\n4. No.\\n5. Yes.\\n\\nOr more precisely:\\n\\n1. No. The goal of AI is not to eliminate the art industry. AI art is the automation of certain tasks in art in order to enable creators to produce higher level work at a reduced cost of access. For example","a filmmaker or a small team could conceivably use AI to produce movies","or games","or TV shows","or even forms of media we can\\'t imagine today","for a tiny budget. This isn\\'t unlike how other technologies like CGI or DAWs allowed creators to produce projects in the fields of animation and music without having to go through the full cell animation process","or having to hire a live performing band","which has allowed media to become far cheaper and has allowed many more small teams to enter these industries.\\n2. No. Everyone can produce anything they want from their minds","but this won\\'t make anyone creative or genius. The role of the artist is to create new things from their ability to appreciate other arts and the arts that they themselves create","advancing culture by a drive for exploration of ideas. Computers are unable to create new things on their own because they can\\'t appreciate or have any drive to care about anything","and thus they can\\'t explore styles and ideas. It\\'s physically impossible for a model","as we understand them","to care about anything. This is a skill in itself that requires learning how to appreciate art in any field in the first place. Most people don\\'t know how to do this because they haven\\'t been taught the historical context of art","the principles and the ideas that have led to the current artistic movements that dominate media.\\n3. No","it\\'s not dystopian. It\\'s a technology that abstracts the whole of human knowledge in order to allow humans to create new things for less cost of access. See answers 1 and 2. Artists also have specific training in art that makes them more able to use the computer to create things that serve a specific aesthetic purpose effectively","something that non-artists can\\'t do. If you give the same camera to a photographer and a non-photographer","and bring the two of them to the same place","the photographer will always take better pictures than the non-photographer. Same thing with AI","or any other technology (Because of what I explained in answer 2.).\\n4. It depends on how you define spam","and how you define \"everyone\". If it\\'s someone generating 1000 anime girls in 2 hours and throwing them on DeviantArt","then yeah","that\\'ll get old quick (And the person responsible probably didn\\'t even look at them). If by spam you mean people producing \"x thing as an 80s dark fantasy film\" on YouTube","I think some people will appreciate it because it\\'s amusing","but it\\'ll get old","just like \"Thanos looking for his mom at the supermarket\" got old like 8 months ago. If it\\'s people exploring styles and creating new pieces that mean something after a lot of iteration","even if it\\'s entirely AI","then it\\'ll probably always have someone who can appreciate it.\\n5. See answers 2 and 3. Also","it seems to me you answered your own question.","To your first two questions. No. Quite simply Ai is a tool. It does not replace human creativity. If anything it is enabling more creativity. It allows artists","photographers","and other creatives to experiment and prototype compositions quickly. In addition those that have been unable to get into traditional art are being inspired and picking up the pen and paintbrush. \\n\\nAlso it will never replace traditional art no matter how good it gets. Im sure there will be people responding to this comment saying it will","but photography and photoshop makes cgi makes traditional art meaningless because they can render such realistic results oh wait no it doesnt. Its just a tool. Inspite of  all the fear mongering","Ai has shown itself to INCREASE human creativity. Not replace it. Personal experience it has inspired my 8 year old son to try new idea and and let his imagination loose. Now he has three notebooks full of sketches","characters","and comic strips that he has made by being inspired by his Ai art creations. That is what the goal for Ai image generation is and has been the whole time. \\n\\nAi is incapable of doing anything without human instruction. That is what prompting is. It will help a new generation of creatives and there are MANY artists who support Ai and are incorporating into there toolkit. However there is such a stigma from a vocal minority that they keep it close to the chest instead of letting others know.","1. Depends on what you mean by Art","but in general AI art will destroy many professions","illustration","comics","directing","sculpting","writing","concept","fashion design","all incredibly deduced before being gone forever as now anybody can do them easily","quickly and cheaply to a satisfying quality. Really well lose the ability to make money from craftsmanship and other creative tasks.\\n\\n2. No","it will just make art boring and along with the sheer mass of content being produced I would think that people would move onto other things. Visual and audio art could be seen as a tired medium that nobody really has any interest in anymore","so perhaps well return to live theatre and dance.\\n\\n3. You would be a happy last-man worker who gets his regulated content for his consumption","but in the end youll either get the meat grinder","eusociality eugenics for the colony or mass death to reach techno-tribalism","take your pick.\\n\\n4. It does appear everyone agrees that the spam is a bad thing","though nobody will be able to stop it coming. I doubt you could ever stop AI spam without a Tumblr exodus scenario playing out for anyone who tries","especially when AI gets so good it becomes indistinguishable from art created by humans or even photos. I could see a social media exodus happening though.\\n\\n5. Nothing to my mindit does appear that AI will eliminate any need for craftsmanship and mastery","leaving us as a bunch of idea guys","truly horrifyingbut Id say designers may remain useful for at least another 5 years.","1. I dont think its anyones goal to remove any industries such as the art industry","but sometimes industries become obsolete because of the advancements of tech","but its the side effect not the agenda. Cant really say that there will be no art jobs after the smoke clears because absolutely everything includes some sort of design work that AI itself has no applications for. An AI generator might be able to draw the logo","but its still going to be up to humans to make the prints and adjust the settings on the machines","even if its programming the machines to do the printing on the other machines. Theres too many creative decisions that still need human direction. Will many jobs disappear? Likely","yes. But AI automation is going to wipe out jobs in every sector of the workforce in the next few decades. This will all be ok though","if we can redirect humanitys focus off being a exploitative labor based world","and shift to a world that values human life and the quality of its experience.\\n\\n2. Everyone IS an artist. Some of us have just decided to develop better skills to better express our creativity. Most art was meaningless to begin with. The measure of the true value of art is subjective. The amount of people producing art with new tools is exploding and will continue to. Traditional skills will start to die down but will never disappear","and the intrinsic value of hand made art as opposed to AI generated art will skyrocket in monetary value as they become more scarce.\\n\\n3. Humans will transition from art laborers to art directors","producers","curators","and consumers. You will see less and less specialists. Gone will be the days of painter or graphic designer. The generalist humans of the near future will have a little bit of everything under their belts to use to create grand projects like immersive video games","movies","interactive novels","and new ways to tell stories that we havent even conceived yet. To me this is Utopian rather than Dystopian. There are great creative visionaries everywhere and the only thing they are missing is the tools.\\n\\n4. Spamming in general is frowned upon. And if you find AI annoying than that form of spam is even less welcome.\\n\\n5. AI will be implemented into every facet of society. Every artist who plans on keeping a career will be forced into learning this technology so it may be incorporated into every professional artists workflows. In the same way Adobe products have become required learning and essential tools within the entirety of the graphic design world. The only thing artists need to do is grow and adapt with the tech.

This is a huge deal that could signal the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. If Microsoft's predictions of the far-reaching implications of the technology prove to be true, it could trigger a realignment in the AI world as other tech groups race to stake out their place in the new field of generative AI.\nOpenAI recently made headlines with the launch of ChatGPT, an AI system that can answer queries and produce text in natural-sounding language. However, Microsoft executives believe that the technology behind the service will soon have a deeper impact throughout the tech world. Eric Boyd, Head of AI Platforms at Microsoft, stated that \"these \\[AI\\] models are going to change the way that people interact with computers.\"\nThis investment comes as venture capitalists are rushing to back the latest AI trend at a time when previous investment fads like blockchain and cryptocurrencies have faded. Microsoft made its first $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019, sealing a role as the tech platform for the firm's highly demanding AI models and giving it first rights to commercialize its technology.\nIf you want to learn more about this development in the AI world and how it could shape the future, then I invite you to check out my in-depth analysis of this topic on my YouTube channel by clicking the link below:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hvH-NQcWms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hvH-NQcWms)\nLet me know your thoughts on this exciting development in the comments.","comments":["**Thank you for your post and for sharing your question","comment","or creation with our group!**\\n\\n* Our welcome page and more information","can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/x7s6t6/welcome_to_ai_art/)\\n* For self-promotion","please only post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/1040fpe/ongoing_selfpromotion_thread_promote_your/)\\n* Find us on **Discord** [here](https://discord.gg/h2J4x6j8zC)\\n\\n*Hope everyone is having a great day","be kind","be creative!*\\n\\n*I am a bot","and this action was performed automatically.

{"id":"10fw46k","title":"I believe that the most prominent element of the foundation of the anti AI art sentiment is The Uncanny Valley, and no one is discussing it because no one knows how to yet.","content":"Within the past month I've bathed myself in the entire spectrum of anti AI sentiments across the internet in search of trying to relate to this kind of zombified way of thinking that \"my art, my way of art completely belongs to me.\" I feel completely alien toward every anti AI argument I've heard so far. I haven't spoken to a single person or have read a single comment that makes any logical sense. And when you try to have a relaxed discussion explaining how the tech actually works, or you try to promote the benefits of AI, or you try to compare this new tech to inventions of the past, it rarely ever has a positive effect. It's almost like they can't hear the sound of any reason over the loudness of their internal fears.\nI'm suggesting that what we are actually seeing is nothing like how it is being presented by either proponents or opponents of the subject of AI generative art. Legalities, Ethics, Copyright concerns, Plagiarism, fear of CP being generated(I won't downplay the evil that is this example. It genuinely scares me too), Job loss, The Soulessness debate, etc. are all strawmen for an underlying innate fear that is present in most humans. And that's The Uncanny Valley. \nI think this goes far beyond every way we can try to rationalize why AI art is inherently \"wrong.\" It's far bigger than just intellectual propterty matters and labor cuts in a Catpitalist world. We just collectively as a consciousness don't yet have the awareness to put our innate fears into language and therefore can't translate those innate fears into a rational and orderly world built of trademark protections and the extreme Capitalist valuation of manual labor. I think we are currently experiencing an anomaly to the likes humanity has never seen... or at least hasn't seen in a VERY long long time, possibly predating mainstream accepted history.\nI think we have unleashed an Uncanny Valley mass panick episode on a global scale. Before I proceed I need to make sure you're on board on what exactly the Uncanny Valley is. Without going into much detail that can be better described in other more focused disussions surrounding it, simply it's the innate fear of things that appear human but are not. Or more specifically, it's the point in which a human recognizes that something appears human but doesn't behave ENOUGH like an actual human that it creates an irrational internal terror within the human observer. Researchers have been studying the phenomena for a few decades by now and they are nowhere near close to understanding WHY The Uncanny Valley exists within the human psyche. There are only a few loose hypotheses.\nOur understanding of the Uncanny Valley thus far has mostly been focused on visual appearance. Most examples of it can be fit to images of humanoid like figures. In an animated sense, the humanoid figure may not move or speak like a human then triggering the fear. But what I think is happening now is that humans for the first time en masse are seeing a non human entity that is replicating a human behavior that is deeply nuanced and essential to defining the Human Experience. This is driving everyone insane on a level that they can't fully comprehend. The anti AI art protesters are responding with their animalistic instincts that the machine is violating a human space. It's linked to our innate fear of intruders, especially intruders trying to disguise themselves as one of us to deceive us. The reactions are evolutionary in nature and are not equipped to interact with post-animalistic intelligence that operates without its own willpower. \nThis is where claims like, \"the machine is stealing art from artists\" are derived from. A cognitive dissonance is formed in the anti-AI brain that this thing behaves like a human so it has the ability to steal like a human would, but also this thing is nowhere near human so it can't create a quality image with human soul. Which is it? Does it do human stuff or not?\nWe are hearing arguments that it is unethical to train a robot how to create art in a living human artist's style. Even when you try to explain that the robot is merely studying the images in datasets just as another human would, not storing them in any physical database, not creating remix collages, not recreating or replicating images, etc. The response usually indicates that none of those things matter because it all goes right back to the idea that we want this training gatekept from non human learning systems. But no one I've encountered so far has the ability to express exactly why it is such a huge violation to artists outside of financial and labor/craftmanship based fears.\nBecause I can't get a great human self analysis of what about AI is freaking them out, I have to extrapolate from the absence of data that this phenomena must be related to the Uncanny Valley. \nNow I have my own ideas from some of my personal experiences with AI and the UV. I'm extremely pro AI, to the point where I feel more in common with robots than I do human. Perhaps I have an undiagnosed case of autism that got lost when I was being diagnosed with other things like ADHD, OCD, PTSD, DID and several other things ending in D. But I'm a classic INTP who always related more to the magical or robotic non human characters of every universe. Data from Star Trek, Orko from He-Man, Robin Williams in Bicentennial Man, etc. The UV doesn't trigger me or creep me out in the way it does other people. I actually feel a sense of home when I think about the UV. It's probably because I only feel vaguely human, and irl I'm always masking to appear human toward other fellow humans, but I always know that most of my small talk interactions are vaguely authentic themselves.\nI admittedly get a lot of amusement out of watching the terror generated by humans when they encounter the UV. It's bittersweet for me considering there's so much human behavior in this shithole world that absolutely terrifes me.\nBut I definitely feel this correlation between one's acceptance of AI and their innate response to the UV. Perhaps it's as simple as some people have more fear of the unknown than others and both AI, and UV are unfamiliar territories. I'm someone who tends to be always extremely intrigued and endlessly curious of the unknown. Ever since AI has been used in image generation, going back 5 years ago now, I've always had to be the first person to explore how it works. But also to use it in my art. And my surreal style is very much rooted in expressing the UV so it has always felt really right to use AI within it.\nThis is where I will likely lose some of you. Throughout my mushroom journeys, I had some pretty deep revelations about the state of humanity. In short, I think we've been lied to about the origins of humanity, and we're just a bunch of water based biomechanical robots ourselves who were designed specifically to be energy laborers for slavemasters that we don't even know exist and it's been withheld from all of us just exactly WHY we exist. I actually think the UV is our innate fear of being replaced as current labor models. Not even so much are people afraid of being replaced in the workforce, I think people are experiencing a programmed evolutionary trait to be weary of a next generation robot that will make their entire being obsolete. The Ego was installed in humans as a survival crutch. It will fight to ensure that there is a need for humanity to continue to have a validated existence, even when perhaps our survival is not even threatened, but our usefullness to the masters who commisioned to have us designed is being threatened. Pre programmed Stockholm Syndrome and allegiance to something we know nothing about.\nI think the hidden feature of the UV works directly in tandem with the Ego. The Ego validates human usefullness which results in industrious survival tactics. Perhaps the humanoid like creatures or apparatuses are not even our biggest fear, but they are simple reminders that we are replaceable if we become less useful. Maybe they are just reminders that our biggest fears lie in the potential within ourselves.","comments":["I think it relates more to a fetishistic disavowal  of their art.

{"id":"10jtst0","title":"AI Art impact on the way studios deal with copyright (forget about the dataset issue)","content":"https://preview.redd.it/megputo1awda1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2186ab680249b5704a07b59bc4fd4716fac8d285\nSo, I would like to begin this saying I'm not referring to the dataset debate. For all intends and purposes, let's assume that the courts decided that you can use copyrighted material to train AIs and that you can copyright what you create with that.\nWith that said, obviously, copyright law would still exist. Like, you wouldn't be allowed to – **legally** – make a Star Wars, or a Mario, or a Zelda movie using AI art or any art form whatsoever. Those are all copyrighted material, and any execution of those unauthorized characters is protected by law. But the key word here is LEGALLY. Because people surely will create fan art regardless of whether it is legal or not...\nAs they have been doing for decades at this point, with the difference that fan art usually gets restricted to books and images, things which require less money to be created and that can be created by just 1 or 3 people. Unlike a full blown movie, where you need a lot of folks and money to create and – all in all – there are a lot room for studios to just sue you into oblivion before anything gets made. Let alone the fact that you wouldn't even be able to monetize the product. So it's just a nightmare for anyone wanting to create a fan movie nowadays.\nBut the key word here is LEGALLY. Because illegally people sure as hell will create all sorts of movies using AI Art, and the algorithm will make as easy/affordable to anyone to be able to create their own movies using anything honestly, and I just don't see much room for studios being able to prevent you, aside trying to sue some torrent site – which simply doesn't work honestly. And those fan movies will be as good, maybe even better, than the ones creates by studios.\nAnd I was wondering how will studios deal with that? Like, at first, they sure as hell will trie to sue anyone posting those homemade hollywood-like copyright infringers movies and series, but I don't see that working. Maybe there would be some platform where people post fan versions and the copyright owner receive something? I don't know...\nAlso, how close can you create something to avoid copyright? Like, make a movie close to Forrest Gump, but change just enough to not be considered a copyright infringement? I know this is not an issue caused only by AI, but AI makes considerably easier to just \"video2video\" a movie until doesn't violates copyright anymore.\nAnyway, what are your two cents on others AI art might affect the way studios deal with copyright? Honestly, I just think studios will have to accept any deal that they can get, because otherwise people will just generate AI-generate their own fan movies and share them anyway...\nWhat made me think on this was this \"Family Guy 80s Sitcom\" opening someone made using Midjorney. I was watching that and I thought, boy, I would really watch this show.

There's the actual training of the AI Model and finally there's the AI generated output.\n\nOn the downloading of the copyrighted images into a dataset, I believe this does constitute a form of copyright infringement. The specific right that is being infringed upon is the exclusive right of reproduction of the copyright holder. Web scraping while legal does have a few exceptions; you cannot  scrape the personal data of someone and you cannot scrape copyrighted content. The copyright office recognizes that the performance and display of an image within a website does not constitute as publication and thus it is not authorized for reproduction. I think this would require a fair use defense for the downloading of the works.\n\nI am of the belief that training isn't infringement considered the data that derived from the copyrighted works are not protected by copyright. The AI does not collage copyrighted pictures together and the latent space does not contain any of the images that is has trained on. The statistical properties of works are not really any something that's protected by copyright and it cannot be used to reconstruct the original images either. Something that is protected by copyright would have to be the specific creative expression that is unique to the copyright holder. I don't believe the resulting model is a derivative by the legal definition in the copyright lawbook. A quick wikipedia look up would say\n\n>a derivative work is an expressive creation that includes major *copyrightable* elements of an original\n\nor from the copyright practices compendium book.\n\n>The fact that the author incorporated uncopyrightable elements of a preexisting work into his or her work does not necessarily mean that the author’s expression qualifies as a derivative work. For example, merely incorporating a word, letter, number, or common geometric shape from one or more preexisting works does not constitute derivative authorship.\n\nI think the least interesting part of this debate is the AI generated output. It is just a question of how much human authorship is copyrightable. I don't think this is relevant to the lawsuit at all besides how it will affect the market share. If the output contains infringing material such as the specific expression of a copyright holder, I think that would be best judged on a case by case basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTitle 17 of United States Code gives these exclusive rights to the copyright holder with regards to the images\n\n>**(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;**\n\nThis is covered in my first point which I believe infringes upon the right of the copyright holder.\n\n>**(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;**\n\nI don't think this has been infringed upon by the model because it does not meet the definition of a derivative.\n\n>**(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;**\n\nI don't think this right is relevant because StabilityAI did not distribute the copyrighted work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that the right of reproduction is infringed upon so what I want to talk about is how would we able to mount a fair use defense for the reproduction or how it might not meet fair use?\n\nFactor 1: The Purpose and Character of the Use.\n\nFactor 2: The Nature of the Copyrighted Work.\n\nFactor 3: The Amount or Substantiality of the Portion Used.\n\nFactor 4: The Effect of the Use on the Potential Market for or Value of the Work.","comments":["Google downloads every single picture on the web","and multiple companies download the picture to perform that transmission.\\n\\nI doubt just downloading a picture without redistribution could constitute any copyright violation.

{"id":"10o4m0v","title":"Let's settle this once and for all","content":"01) AI generated art is not theft, stealing or robbery, period. To qualify as such, there has to be a loss of property.\n02) AI generated art is not plagiarism because there's no copying. There's only machine learning. If the AI were simply copying from another source, then the model file wouldn't be a few gigabytes. It would be MUCH bigger.\n03) Piracy implies a potential loss of revenue. Model training does not cause anyone to lose revenue. \n04) Training from someone else artwork and selling it is more complicated. If someone was stabbing another person, you go after the stabbing person. You shouldn't go after the knives, the knife makers or random knife users. If someone was profiting from another person, you go after that particular seller. You shouldn't go after the AI generators, the AI creators or random AI artists.\n05) If you don't want your picture to be used for the purpose of human or machine learning, then you shouldn't even upload it in the first place.\n06) Soul is a social construct. One cannot objectively define whether or not a piece of artwork has a soul. If you define soul by human input, then both AI art and traditional art require human input.\n07) It doesn't matter how you do it. If you create art then you are an artist. End of story.\n08) It's true that many traditional artists will lose jobs to AI artists but that's not a bad thing. You shouldn't place bans or restrictions on cars simply because horse riders were losing jobs to drivers. If you were a horse rider you could either learn to drive or find another job that suits you. If you are a traditional artist you can either join us and become an AI artist or find another job that suits you. \n09) It's also true that AI generated art can flood the market but again that's not a bad thing. Smart phones, computers, email, cameras, smart TV etc have already flooded the market and I cannot imagine living without them. I look forward to the day we can finally replace crappy, obviously fake 3D renders with beautiful, highly realistic AI generated art.\n10) Next time someone tells you you are training on other people's artwork without knowledge, permission or compensation, remind them this happens all the time in music schools. They have been training on the artwork of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach etc without knowledge, permission or compensation.\n11) AI generated art is no more unethical than a musical cover, a movie remake or a game remake. If it were unethical for us to make an AI model from a third party, then it would also be unethical for Johnny Cash to make Hurt from a third party, which is Nine Inch Nails. It would be unethical for the Bloober Team to make Silent Hill 2 from a third party, which is Team Silent.\nNow let's talk about all the benefits since very few people did:\n12) AI generators allow physically disadvantaged people to create art. Before the existence of AI art, only the most skilled people can create art. Nowadays a 10 year old, a 70 year old and a disabled person can create art thanks to AI. A disabled person made a post in the AIArt subreddit a few weeks ago. They were able to create art for the first time of their life. They were so happy that they were in tears. \n13) AI generators allow poor people to afford their own art collection. Don't forget there are many poor people around the world. Many of them barely have enough money to pay for their rent or education. Obviously, they were unable to pay commission artists and build their own art collection before. However, they can afford all the free to use AI generators and start their own collection now.\n14) AI generators will be used to create pornography. \"Why are you suggesting this? Are you a pervert?\" Think again. A lot of women were coerced into the adult industry. They have to deal with higher rates of STDs, sexual harassment, rape threat, death threat etc. They are often disrespected by both men and women. Some of them are cut off by their own family and friends. They can never live a normal life again. We can prevent all this if we allow AI pornography to replace real life pornography.\n15) One of the most upvoted comments in TwoXChromosomes was about how women wish sex robots existed so that men would leave them alone. We don't have sex robots yet but we do have AI art. With AI art you can already tell women or men to smile, dance, undress and it will only get better. It's only a matter of time before AI can generate something equally or even more appealing than real life women. If we allow AI art it is likely more men will stop pursuing women and go after the AI instead.\n16) Foreveralone and Incel men are on the rise. They are sad, frustrated or angry that they failed to find a girlfriend for whatever reason. Many of them have mental issues. Some of them are suicidal. Some of them can be a danger to themselves and/or other people if untreated. While we cannot offer them a girlfriend, we can at least lessen the problem by offering them the opportunity to generate their ideal woman.","comments":["Post this to r/aiwars.","Firstly","this issue will likely never be \"settled","but especially not by a random reddit post.

{"id":"10oeid1","title":"Maybe we should stop calling these new fancy products ‘AI’ …","content":"It is the opinion of many who understand this topic (better than I do) to claim that many of the popular advertised ‘AI’ products are not created by self thinking sentient machines; therefore, many of these programs could be disputed as being truly Artificially Intelligent. From what I’ve learned, it seems to me that it would be fair to call them sophisticated copy machines that depend on (soon to be illegal?) data scraping methods in order to function; it could be considered false advertising for a corporation to claim that these products are ‘Artificial Intelligence’. There are a few pending lawsuits against some notable ‘AI’ advertised products and companies that will more than likely change the way we define these widely-believed to be unethically-sourced ‘AI’ products. The preferred term among the science circles seems to be that these ‘AI’ products are mostly using Machine Learning techniques and currently, many popular models have a staggering amount of copyright issues at the time of this writing.   \n\n\nIt is my strong opinion that inventions that rely on copyrighted material are not really inventions, they are plagiarisms disguised as a new advancement. An invention is something that builds on a new idea. It seems to me, that right now ‘AI’ products are very advanced collage tools, and rooted in the same process of machine learning that has existed for over 30 years now. There doesn’t seem to be any new ideas here, it’s a simple technology that just performs an augmented level of copy and paste. I mean, are we seriously letting corporations essentially monopolize every industry from this moment forward? It’s one thing to use these discoveries for research, it is another to profit off of the whole World Wide Web. There’s so many potential infringement cases that will spawn from this misrepresented technology and that is a very sad reality to me. Artificial Intelligence when devised by science fiction writers was something a lot more complex than the algorithmic computations and the automated decision-making that a programmer puts in place. It seems to be hubris to assume that humanity has achieved creating a conscious and critical thinking entity at this time in history.","comments":["Part of this essay is correct - these are no Ai machines","and yes ML was used for decade until recently when it turned out Ai just sounded cooler.

{"id":"10trydu","title":"AI Art as Commission: Defining the Relationship between User and Generator","content":"As the popularity and complexity of AI art rises, so do the questions about the nature of such art: Are the users of AI art generators the ‘creators’ of the art? Or is the AI model? Do the users ‘own’ the art they generate? And most of all, Is AI art ‘creation?’ One of the most foundational steps when dealing with abstract concepts, is that of defining the terminology. We need a starting point to argue what’s what, and we do that by being as clear and precise about the meanings of our terms as possible. \nBut this doesn’t always happen, and certainly in the case of AI art, there is still much conflict going on about terms and the nature of the art. And so I am here today to offer a constructive perspective in order to untangle some of these questions to start us on a firmer foundation when discussing issues of AI art generation.\nI have recently come upon an analogy that I believe will help us sort out these questions in the future. And this is to understand the relationship of ‘AI art generator to User’ as one of *commission*. \n**It is my thesis that we should define the relationship between the art AI and the program User as that of a commission, rather than creation.** I believe this new understanding will resolve some of the current conflicts and confusions about ownership and creation that we deal with today.\nI will illustrate my point through analogy and example. First let’s check out the Meriam Webster definition (2) of Commission:\n“...b**:** a formal request to produce something (especially an artistic work) in exchange for payment. also **:** a work produced by commission” [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commission](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commission)\n&#x200B;\nIn the art world, it is not uncommon for individuals to contact an artist with a request to create a specific piece of art. Here is a simple explanation of the Commissioning process:\n1. An artist is contacted by an individual who would like them to create a certain kind of artwork for them\n2. The artist accepts the commission and receives the specifications from the person about what exactly they would like\n3. The artist works on their own to create the work\n4. The artist gives the person the finished piece for an agreed upon compensation, whether in the form of money or publicity, or otherwise.\nNow, let’s compare this to the way AI art is generated:\n1. A User utilizes a certain software program that generates art\n2. The User adds keywords, details, prompts, specifications and any other description about what it wants the AI to generate\n3. The AI program does the generation process\n4. When the program is complete, the AI displays the final product for the User\nNotice the similarities? Like with a traditional artist, a User goes to the AI program and *commissions* a specific work, according to the User’s preferences. The AI then completes this work that it was commissioned to do. We wouldn’t say a person A who commissioned an artist for a painting ‘created’ the painting. They asked for it, inspired it through their desires, but we know it is the actual artist who created the painting. In this same way, the User *did not create* the artwork itself; they simply commissioned the AI to make it.\nNow, there are a few legal and copyright issues that this Commissioning Relationship can help with as well. Back to our example, suppose person A commissioned their painting and then entered that painting in a contest. Well, yes, they own the piece, but it’s not their place to enter it into a contest as their own. Because they are not the creator, only the commissioner. And again, if person A has their commissioned painting but then tries to sell copies of it online as the artist–that is not their place because A didn’t create it. The artist still reserves copyright of their own creative work, as the creator.\nIf we apply this to AI art, then it means that we shouldn’t willy-nilly enter AI art into contests, claiming a User’s name as the creator–because that’s not really what it is. AI art will have a place in AI art contests or projects that specifically allow and include AI art. There will need to be many requirements in place to ensure that AI art is clearly marked, and when it is and is not allowed. \nWith the selling part, selling AI art has less of an issue with breaking copyright than the traditional artist example, because the AI itself can’t own the image, only potentially the humans involved (company providing AI art service, the User, etc…). The copyright details depend on the platform, but in this case, AI art that is sold should be clearly marked as AI-generated, and should give credit where credit is due to the model used. It will all depend on what way Users are allowed to profit from art they commissioned from each individual AI art generator.\nMany traditional artists are voicing criticism of AI art, and that it is not ‘art’ nor ‘creation.’ Using this new terminology and understanding, serves to better categorize and contextualize AI art in a way that is less invasive to the traditional art space. In this framework, it is true that Users are not ‘creators’ nor ‘artists’ in the same sense as traditional ones. AI art can be understood as its own separate world of art, that need not endanger the traditional art world. And if we clarify AI art generation for what it is–*commissioning–*then we take a step forward on a clearer path in this issue.\n\\*\\*\\*\nI would love to start a conversation about this topic. Has this idea been addressed before in this way? What do you think of AI art as ‘commission’? I think it would greatly help the art community if this idea could catch on.","comments":["I searched for this as I have reached the same conclusion.  If you commission an artwork","you are the client.  If you commission an artwork and then claim to be the artist","you are a plagiarist.

I see benefits to both sides of the AI argument, but neither group is a monolith, and I don't represent you guys.\n\nHere's some of the benefits I see:\n\n* Pro-AI\n   * AI Training: \n      * AI isn't quite ready to be trained with AI generated art. This tool has the potential to help filter out images that may reinforce some of a model's bad habits.\n   * Minimizing controversy:\n      * Regardless of the ethics surrounding the issue, people don't like to be tricked. I've seen posts that have implied that lying about the provenance of an image is the smartest thing for an individual AI assisted artist to do. A scandal of widespread dishonesty would do nothing to help normalize this technology. Much to the credit of the the AI Art community, these people face heavy criticism.\n* Anti-AI\n   * Method Specific Competition:\n      * Computers can play chess, and Go better than everyone on earth. It's fun to see how well computers can play against people, but they don't belong in every tournament. A tool that can reliably determine whether an image was made with the method determined in the rules would help promote the spirit of such competitions.\n   * Community Moderation:\n      * Some communities are about the process, or the medium. A photograph, for example, doesn't belong in a community about photo-realism. If you're engaged in the process, or the community disagrees with the philosophy behind generative AI assisted art, I think you'd benefit quite a bit from this.\n\nI, of course, have my own thoughts on the matter (and talk about this regularly on my main account) but I'd like to avoid coloring anyone's opinions by stating where I sit in this argument. Again, I don't represent you guys, nor do I claim to represent you. No group is a monolith, and I'm just one person.

That is hypocrisy.   \nI can't trust that they're doing the right thing anymore.  \nI *am* a copyright advocate though, have been for years because I'm stolen from a LOT and I post about copyright news to help educate other artists about how to protect themselves. And yet, I'm fine with ai art except for when people purposefully copy someone else using their work in img2img, etc. I never encountered any of the plaintiffs in any of the artist copyright spaces or discussions online, hadn't seen them speak out about the rampant infringement that so many of us deal with before ai art came around, never heard of Karla before this all started. Hell, Karla and Kelly never even registered their work with the copyright office so this is likely their first experience in the world of copyright law. Now they supposedly care, but not enough to follow copyright rules & etiquette themselves when it comes to other artists' work I guess.\nI've been watching this movement unfold since it started. I'd followed Kelly McKernan for years as an admired artist, and I was ready to quit MidJourney when I saw Kelly McKernan's post on Facebook about the derivative copies of her work created 'with a simple text prompt in MidJourney', except that wasn't what happened at all. I questioned Kelly about it on that post because, when I tried the same prompt the results were wildly different and nothing like their work. I was testing and posting my results in real time in the comments, but they waited until I brought it up again the next morning to correct the post and I wonder if they would've left the accusation up if they had not been challenged on it. Eventually they admitted that it was done with Stable Diffusion, I'm sure it was using img2img. They removed the word 'MidJourney' from that post in an edit, but the tweet with the same accusation stayed up and thousands of people had already seen the post before the edit. The corrections should be as loud and obvious as the mistakes but that hasn't been how they're handling things unfortunately.\nI had given them the benefit of the doubt that they must've been given bad information rather than intentionally misleading people. And in fact, I bet they had already started the process of filing the lawsuit when that post went up, thinking they had a smoking gun for evidence.\nBut in the end, there was actually no evidence of copies filed in the Exhibits for the lawsuit at all. And the promotion of misinfo about ai image generators seemed to continue. They promoted that Stable Attribution program that turns out to be a fraud, just a similar image detector. If it does work, if anything it seems to show that generated images truly ARE transformative and fair use, original images that don't look like copies of the source material at all. And although all 3 of the plaintiffs were tagged in a tweet by someone calling out Stable Attribution for lying, none of them shared that info to set the record straight with all their followers who had seen them promote that tool previously. And Kelly had posted a reply tweet at the very end of the thread that falsely attributed the copies to MidJourney, but we all know reply tweets don't get seen the way the original one does, so it was the falsehood that spread widely.\nAlthough there's definitely toxicity from some ai users harassing or mocking artists who are worried about their careers that I don't like, a lot of toxicity has come from the anti-ai side as well. People who use ai generators are dunked on as thieves, as lazy, as stupid, etc. If it were simply about using ethical datasets we wouldn't see them calling a physical disability a 'bullshit excuse' to use ai.\nSo for one of the leaders of this movement to go and use someone else's work like that is really wild.\nI tracked down the artists who created the works they shared, something that the person posting should be doing rather than telling whoever asked to go do a reverse image search themselves. I would never post someone else's work without credit unless the point of the post was to find the artist, especially if I have a large platform where the image would be downloaded and spread further because that eventually can lead to someone trying to monetize it too.\nThe one seen in that screenshot is Hovering Dosa on Tumblr, the one with the couple in the futuristic living room is by Paul Alexander and the other one is by Ray Cummings.\nThere's more that I think is going on, but I need to get more info before discussing it publicly as it would be a big issue legally and this is already too long.\nI do NOT want any of the artists harassed on my behalf, I just want folks to know who they're really dealing with and to not put all your trust in popular artists stirring up panic about this issue as it seems to be opportunistic. Kelly had told me they didn't think I had artists' interests at heart when I stated my opinion about ai art, but to me it seems to be the other way around.","comments":["Very informative!

{"id":"113jg9y","title":"I'm getting more commissions as an AI artist than I ever got before as a purely traditional and digital artist. Here are some takeaways.","content":"So this is my alt account. I created Braad Tittt as the alternative account on every social media and art platform that is just purely dedicated to making digital art that features beautiful women with big tiddies. (I will incorporate beautiful men if there is a demand for it.) \nI started this project two years ago as an AI assisted digital art project for Instagram. Back then I just did traditional morphing with Photoshop/Ibis Paint and I used FaceApp to alter the appearance of my models. This past year gave us all sorts of advancements in AI generative art. When Stable Diffusion dropped in August, I immediately tied it into my workflow as it is open source and is trained on NSFW imagery.\nWhile I had been building a following on Instagram 2 years ago, I decided that maybe I'd have more luck on a more art dedicated community such as Deviant Art who within the past few months came out as being incredibly pro AI despite half of their current anti AI user base. So I started posting my stuff there and found that they are also a platform to host commission work.\nAs a freelance artist for most of my existence, I made the mistake of applying my thoughts of commissions when it comes to actual drawing/painting to the work involved with AI generated content. So here I am telling you all that, that was a huge mistake!\nI expected to have my AI commissions to take way less time than my hand drawn commissions. I was so wrong.\nAs an artist, when you approach your canvas you expect to just draw or paint for several hours putting the ink or paint where it needs to be to create the vision. You create the outlines, the sketches, the anatomy of your piece, as a base to add everything else on. As an AI artist, I just realized that you spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME generating the images as you do to provide your initial sketch as a traditional artist. In the past it would take me a solid 45 minutes to purely just create the structure via first draft sketch. But when I apply my time to AI assisted art, I find that it takes the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME to generate  a panel of images in which I need to curate from. Generating and curating THE ONE IMAGE can take the same amount of time that it takes to sketch a piece by hand.\nThen after you decide on the image you are going to work on to finalize and then you actually bring the image into the apps that you are using to enhance the image. But say that you're just taking the image and adding FaceApp filters, fixing anatomy issues and size morphing, and then adjusting lighting... when all is said in done, you just spent 2 or so hours on ONE AI generated image, from writing the prompt all the way to adjusting lighting.\nI made the mistake of offering 20 detailed images for $30. The first commission I received at this rate is taking me the whole week to finish because I'm spending about an hour on average on each individual image. But that was something I had to learn by actually getting my feet wet with it. I've already adjusted my pricing tiers and number of outputs based on learning that my labor x time hasn't really changed even though I'm using more AI in my work.\nThe point of sharing my experience is to say that, if you are a serious artist, the AI part still doesn't matter. You are going to spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME on a piece you put work and care into regardless of your medium. The stereotype/trope of putting some words in a box and pushing a button then you're done as an AI artist is such a lame under assessment of what an actual artist actually does when making an image generation truly sellable.\ntl:dr: Don't sell your AI commissions short in contrast to your hand made commissions. You will end up spending the same amount of time on your AI commissions as you do your hand made commissions.","comments":["Been thinking about opening requests on Pixiv.

{"id":"11595k0","title":"My take on the AI art debate: short term pain, long term gain","content":"ChatGPT led to me taking a step back and forcibly maturing my views on the effects of AI and AGI. \nI can't speak with 100% certainty and nothing is absolute. But I have put in some effort to seriously view the near future from a grounded perspective. \nWhen it comes to generative AI, I try to imagine what it looks like if these certain lines are crossed:\n• Magic Media Machine. An AI multimedia studio where you can generate text, images, video, sprites, 3D models, etc. just from simple prompts. It's not rudimentary; you can make a whole novel trilogy, its accompanying movie tetralogy, the comic adaptation, and its AAA open world *and* pixel art visual novel tie in games ***and*** loads of memes and TikTok-style shorts about it in a day or two, if not faster.\n• Widespread saturation. If you have an internet connection, you can use the Magic Media Machine, online or downloaded \n• Awareness. Most people know of the MMM's existence.\nSo what does the pop culture landscape look like?\nBefore last month, I'd say \"all humans fall into their own personal realities.\"\nNow? This is going to sound mental, but I don't think things are going to be *that* radically different. The biggest difference will be the collapse of major entertainment studios. But I no longer see the entertainment singularity I once did. \nBasing off my interactions with average people and looking at how most people interact with media, I foresee this situation:\n• 60% of people don't create anything. They are pure consumers who don't care about the labor that went into what they're consuming. By \"don't create anything,\" I am exaggerating a bit. They *do* regularly synthesize media, but this doesn't go much further than the bare minimum: mildly editing existing media to fit their preferences and interests, making memes and macros, and generally using generative AI as an addition to the internet.  Otherwise, these are pure \"consooomers\"\n• 30% maximum who are devoutly pro-human. These types will go out of their way to consume and produce \"artisanal\" or human-made media, which will become something of a delicacy. Some of the most fanatical types will even go out of their way to only concern themselves with *purely* hand-crafted media with as little digital technology involved as possible. Most AI artists I've seen are courteous enough to mark their creations as AI generated, and I expect future regulations to force these sorts of watermarks to exist, so it won't be as much of a case of \"they'll get scammed all the time\" as you might think. \n• 10% who predominantly or totally persist in the realm of AI generated media. These are the creators and consumers who fully exploit AI for their workflow to the point the AI does all of the work. They don't bother with any other media except to alter it to serve their own desires. Some extreme hikikomori even go so far as to escape entirely into their own fabricated reality media bubbles.\nAs time goes on, the human-only crowd will shrink, but I don't see it disappearing entirely. It will seem like it at a certain early extreme point, but artists (and I mean \"artists\" in a vague sense, not necessarily just visual artists) will bounce back and form their own artisanal economy. Some because they just love creating stuff; others out of spite and disgust for AI generated media, and more because the human-made market will become lucrative.\nBy 2029, we'll have the raw capability to allow any average person to synthesize a whole franchise on their laptop. But honestly I think that's just an extreme example of what's possible. This expectation among Singularitarians that everyone and their dog will immediately only use AI art for everything comes off as incredibly socially stunted reasoning, more a case of extrapolating the absolute most extreme outcome and applying it to the entire population.\nMost people who are going to use generative AI want to use it to do things like \n• Edit and alter existing media\n• Create voice overs and small animations\n• Chat with fictional characters \n• Fake news\nMost people will be content watching meme videos or making family friendly characters say the N word. \nOnly a tiny fraction will ever use this tech for matters of bringing fictional universes to life. Especially when it becomes clear that 99% of synthetic media isn't even going to be viewed or shared. We humans are social apes; we crave social interaction, whether physical or digital. In fact, we're especially hardwired on the genetic level to seek it.  Even now, deep into the age of social media, the real world still exists and people desperately crave dwelling in it. If we lived in the world /r/Singularity believes we do, everyone would still be hankering for lockdown and quarantine right now, but the exact opposite occurred. \nI predict the most popular AI generated media will largely be meme stuff.\nThe \"Goku vs. Shaggy, ft. Ultra Instinct Shrek\" Pixar Movie. Or 24/7 running AI moe anime streams. Or The Matrix, but everyone is a cute anime girl. \nAnd of course the inevitable \"Audiovisual Fanfiction.net\"\nLike I said, I keep trying to think about it and yet as long as magic media machines exist and are open source, I counterintuitively can't see human-made art fading. Declining, yes, but not dying like so many on /r/Singularity and /r/StableDiffusion want.\nMore auteur projects meant to be taken seriously like mine— the Yabanverse or Babylon Today— might attract SOME attention, but I think AI generated media will, for at least 15 years, follow this pattern:\n• AI art is limited to quick and silly stuff due to limitations\n• Advancements happen rapidly, and the Magic Media Machine begins taking shape \n• Initial amazement at what AI can do \n• Amazement wears off and AI is either accepted or rejected on a personal level \n• Oversaturation sets in as media creation is democratized and jobs are lost, often with corporations burning bridges quickly \n• Period of intense shaming and blowback, where AI generated media is treated as lazy and shameful, *especially* when done by big studios who have the capital to employ artists and entertainers but even small-time indies are thrown under the bus \n• Human art begins to be advertised heavily as artists continue creating media without big capital backing. Actors and musicians keep finding work because people want to exploit using \"the real thing\" \n• People begin valuing human art more due to the labor involved, see AI art as cheaper and lazier but not without merit if effort is put in (this is already happening as well)\n• Serious AI based media creators stick around, might collaborate heavily with human artists, might not, but carve out their niche \n• Most AI generated art becomes quick and silly stuff again but of widely varying levels of quality\n• Generally media becomes segregated between purely human-made, AI-assisted, and AI-generated.\nAlready on DeviantArt I see a glut of AI generated images, and most of them are pretty neat to look at, but they get virtually no attraction, traffic, or recognition no matter how high quality unless there's genuine effort at working on them further or if they're part of some larger project. The stuff clearly made by humans, even if AI assisted, reign supreme. I don't see this changing for more advanced synthetic media. People will share their own AI version of GTA meets The Witcher, their own Miyazakian-style movies, their own Nirvana x Radiohead collaboration albums... and yet I see it being such an incredible glut that \"Verified: Human-Made!\" will become a lucrative tag. \nEven if AI creates media of inconceivably high quality, humans are so irrational that we will still stick with ourselves because human hands made something. \nArguments to the contrary usually go \"But scammers will pretend their AI art is human made.\" And of course they will. But I don't see that as being sustainable, *especially* if the technology is regulated. There's zero chance we won't see AI regulations, by the government and the companies making them alike. \nThen again, we presumably aren't that far from an age where you can ask an AI to program an audiovisual generation machine that lacks all watermarks. Which in itself falls apart if artists do unionize and request in-person proof you can draw, act, or make music. So again, I say \"Who knows.\"\nThings are gonna get very weird, very bizarro, but possibly not entirely dehumanized as some want to believe it will be.\n**Hey! Run this through ChatGPT and ask it to summarize my rambling. What does it say?**\nEdit: Another thing that bothers me is the term 'AI Art.' Personally I don't see generative AI outputs as being art, despite literally being \"The Synthetic Media Guy\" who was calling all this coming about years ahead of time.

While I understand artists will definitely be impacted greatly in the short term, the overall net benefit of the technology is tremendous. Everyone can now have the ability to express their inner hidden world that was previously locked away behind years of training and effort. \n\nNot only that but the benefits extend far beyond that of just art. For example diffusion based models have been used to [generate images of the brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07162)\n\nObviously this will improve medical imaging and diagnostic radiography which could potentially save lives in the future.\n\nI personally feel like if this technology is hindered by lawsuits and legal ramifications (regardless of if you consider the training ethical or not), it'll be a huge loss to our potential future as a whole. Because of this, I personally feel that an artist's careers should not be prioritised over something like this.\n\nThese are just my thoughts and opinions, so I hope I didn't offend anyone! What are your thoughts on this?","comments":["Too soon to tell.\\nAsk again in five years.","I think AI art will change most aspects of visual culture and most of the visual culture industries that currently exist (filmmaking etc). In the short term I think well see new forms of storytelling and a new visual language that incorporates the malleability or lack of visually fixed characters and objects.

It's not a moniker for one's skill in art","if you try to get into art school you're going to get professors who will mock you for how faulty your art is (I mean look at Hitler","he wasn't accepted because his paintings","despite admittedly being very beautiful","had a lot of proportion issues in it.)  \\nit might be a moniker for one's prompting ability? but how long before those prompts with dozens of lines just becomes one word?

This is due to the streamlined asset creation from AI generated textures and models as well as the time saving on rendering lighting (AI can predict light paths/bounces faster - as seen with NVIDIA RTX 4000 series) AI like chatgpt will also give any indie designers with less coding experience an extra hand/stand in for a developer. These improvements will also extend to AAA studios and hopefully cut the amount of crunch work and overtime prior to project release.\\n\\nSame applies to media like film/tv shows as we've seen tools like stable have the ability to make video editing a one click/less extensive process or provide entire scenes without traditional animation or filming and instead through prompting.\\n\\nWriters are already using ai to create original content/covers to accompany their novels. While I know some artists phrase this as a negative as it reduces the amount of commissions from writers - I think that budding writers who are working on a tight or no budget deserve and are fully entitled to pursuing AI as an option when publishing their works and shouldn't be obligated to commission anyone.","nope","ai will probably overtake hand painted art in a matter of time","Generative machine learning models have the potential to make blackmail obsolete because they can create realistic and convincing fake data","including images","videos","and text.

These images could be so realistic that it would be difficult to tell that they are fake","making it much harder for someone to use real images to blackmail someone else.\\n\\nSimilarly","generative models could be used to create fake videos or text that appear to be real but are actually completely fabricated. This would make it much more difficult for someone to use compromising or incriminating information to blackmail someone else.\\n\\nOf course","there is always the possibility that someone could use generative models to create fake data to use for blackmail","but as these models become more widespread and sophisticated","it will become increasingly difficult to tell what is real and what is fake.

{"id":"11eallf","title":"This seems like the best place to ask for some advice.","content":"So I'm using Synthesized Art in the game I am making, and I'm a little leery about how to go about advertising that fact.\n* I do want to be honest and open about it, I think it's really cool what I've been able to accomplish with it, other indie devs could use this to more directly compete against the unfinished AAA corporate trash that keeps being dumped on the market.\n* I have no intention of trying to hide it and pass the art off as something I did with a pen.\n* The current backlash against it could sink my game before it even launches.\n* The current backlash against it could also be a huge boost to my game if it gains negative attention where there was previously none.\nIn the end I'm very trepidatious about even mentioning it. I'd like to at some point even do tutorials or videos targeted to other game developers on how I incorporated it into my workflow. (The technical side of it is moving so damn fast I can barely keep up, but the workflow hasn't changed much since day one, 6m ago).\nI think it's a very cool, and even a marketable aspect of my game. It's sped up development time considerably, and is a potential boon to my (indie game) industry. But it's clearly a huge minefield right now, and I'm just not sure where to step.\nI'm a decent artist myself, but my skills are more technical than creative, so I can take a generated image and turn it into a game-usable asset very quickly, but creating something from scratch usually takes me a long time. So synthesized art has allowed me to bring a game idea to fruition in far FAR less time than if I had made the art myself (and at a higher detail level). Nearly everything, down to the *individual letters of the fonts* have been done with SD. Someone without the technical skills would not be able to turn a thousand generated images into a game, but I'm at a loss how to enter this \"war\" without getting shot.\nNow, many other indie devs have similar art skills as my self, and what they do is what I used to do: grab an image off google and manipulate it into something else that can't be sued for copywrite. Nobody ever bitched about that. Infact photobashing is not only an industry standard, it's how the vast majority of concept art in AAA studios is made. Now THAT is cheating and \"stealing\" in all the ways people are bashing on AI art, yet, nobody cares.\nAnyway, as the title, any advice would be welcome.","comments":["Hire an AI-friendly artist in addition to using SD.

{"id":"11f8jor","title":"Is anyone else pro-AI art but also feels like artists should be compensated for training the models?","content":"I think I might be in a relatively small segment of people who see the great benefits of AI image generators to unlock human creativity at scale, while also seeing the threat it poses to the livelihoods of human artists and the unfairness of not being compensated for training the machine.\n\nIn every discussion I see on the topic, people seem to go all-in on one side or the other.\n\nI just wanted to do a little brain dump on how I see this debate...\n\n**Positives of AI Art**\n\n1. **Democratize Creative Expression**  \nThere are a lot of people out there who might have a lot of interesting ideas but may never have had the time, skill or money to bring them to life. Through AI, they are now able to realize the vision of the imagination and turn it into something tangible. For example, an indie game developer who has a grand vision for a game they'd like to make, but don't have the skill or resources to create the art assets to bring it all together. AI can now help them accomplish that and bring a new work into the world that would otherwise never be seen.\n2. **Faster Prototyping and Ideation**  \nThis is where AI can help even traditional artists. In a short amount of time, you can fully explore the full range of possibilities for your ideas before setting pen to paper or brush to canvas. You can quickly see what works and what doesn't, and get a proper direction. This is more useful for commercial art where there is a \"time is money\" factor. I realize the act of exploration itself is one of the great joys of making art, so it could also be viewed negatively depending on the context. But this is just another tool that exists to speed up the creative process if you'd like to leverage it.\n3. **Exploring Impossible Ideas**  \nI've been using Midjourney for several months now, and as a curious and creative person, it has allowed me to explore my imagination in ways it wasn't really possible before. In some ways, I've begun to view it as a camera for your mind and imagination. And it can also delight and surprise you when the generation doesn't exactly match your vision, but presents something in a different (more interesting) way that you hadn't considered. You can quickly realize any crazy idea you have in your head, and the exploration of the AI's \"imagination\" (which is essentially the collective imagination of humanity) can be fulfilling in of itself, or at minimum entertaining.\n4. **Remixing and enhancing one's own art**  \nThis is where I think there is just so much untapped potential from this tool as traditional artists avoid it. The potential this has for artists and photographers to remix their own work in so many new and interesting ways, and unlock new modes of expression is unreal. Because of the blowback among the art communty, very few are exploring their own work in this way. Got some photography that you'd like to turn into a different art style, or view it on a different planet? This tool let's you do things you couldn't feasibly do before.\n\n**Negatives of AI Art**\n\n1. **No Opt-Out or Compensation for Artists that helped train the model**  \nThis is really my main gripe about AI right now. While yes, an AI in some ways creates \"new art\" in a similar way a human artist would when given an idea to bring to life, it's capabilities are far more powerful and sweeping. Artists never agreed to have their work train this model, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't be forced to, or should be compensated for that.\n2. **Identity Crisis for Human Artists**  \nThis is one where I just don't know how it will shake out. This is the first time in history where we are presented with the notion that a machine can make creative works better than us. What does that do to our minds, our self-worth, our perceptions of self and each other. How will awards and recognition even work because we won't even be reliably able to determine whether the artist made their piece on their own, or whether they just had AI make it for them. And also, the creative process itself is one that helps people grow into themselves and mature. Will the ease of use of producing \"art\" lead to more people not developing these skills and the character-building elements that come from the traditional creative process?I think one potential way this could go is that it will lead to more human artists moving away from digital art and more into more traditional forms of art such as oil painting, sculpting, etc. that can't be replicated in the same way as AI. Perhaps that could be a good thing in some ways.\n3. **Economic Disruption**  \nObviously, this is a major negative, but it also applies to practically any other form of employment that involves a computer, as AI is currently in the process of completely transforming our economy. The thing is, there is really no putting this genie back in the bottle, so we either need to learn how to leverage it, or move into a line of work that won't be as disrupted by the AI revolution. Those include jobs that involve more human to human interaction (nursing, hospitality, etc.) or involve physically manipulating the real world somehow (plumbing, electrician, construction, etc.) No amount of complaining about this is going to change the coming wave, because ultimately our economic system has an incentive structure that rewards efficiency, and AI is far more efficient than human labor could ever hope to be.And then I realize \"commercial art\" isn't \"art\" and never was. It's a way to pay the bills, but it isn't a deep expression of oneself through the creation of art. It's designed to get other people to buy things, nothing more and nothing less. So is it truly a loss for \"art\" if \"commercial art\" is replaced by human+AI output?For most of human history, art was not something people did for money. The few that could make a living that way were funded by ultra-wealthy benefactors. So it seems we might see a return to that.Of course, as a society we will need to figure out a way to serve everyone's needs in this new economy, but that is something that will need to be grappled with across the board.\n\nIn the end, will AI \"end art\"? No, of course not. As long as there are humans, there will be people expressing themselves through art. AI might actually help more people express themselves creatively when they otherwise couldn't, which might not be a bad thing.\n\nThink of it this way, if tomorrow someone invented a robot that surfed better than any surfer who ever lived, would human surfers stop surfing? No, of course not. Because the act of surfing itself is what brings them joy. And so it will be for human artists.\n\nLong live art!","comments":["I am pro-AI and think artists should be compensated","though I still don\\'t know how.

I didn’t even know this image to text thing existed before August or September of last year… so… how do you expect a population to vote on a program like this if you just come out with it without asking? How is this democracy? We've all heard it, the claim that AI art generators as they exist in their current form  will democratize art, but is that true? Is it democratizing art or is it colonizing art? What do colonialists do? They get to a place, take whatever they want and then they say that it's theirs. “YAAY! Colonialists!” Umm NO.

I mean, You are talking about allowing Millions of competitors to use their potentially memorized artwork! Memorization is possible! Call it memorization, or call it overfitting or whatever you want to call it, there is a potential likelihood that the generator will be a plagiarist! Do you want have that responsibility?

Let’s make it ethical… But instead of being heard, what I am seeing is disrespect from a good portion of AI art users… Back to the colonization point… We all want to live in a spacious, beautiful and safe place. We all want the best things in life. But we all have to make a decision … do we want to acquire these things by earning them, by gaining them in a honorable way? I don't know about you but I don't want to be considered a mass murderer of human artists just because I wanted to play around with a program that I can't even get copyrights from...

There's a reason Jackson Pollock works are different from Coco the Gorilla works. \n\nSo, yes, I'm perfectly willing to concede that mindless prompt generation is not an artistic process and the output is not \"art\" in any meaningful sense of the word.\n\nHowever, if someone is using technical skill to train a custom model on images or styles selected according to their intention and artistic taste, using technical skill to create ControlNet masks which specify the exact composition of an image according to intention and artistic taste, using technical skill to inpaint details according to their intention and artistic taste, and composing the output images into a greater whole such as a themed collection, comic, or videogame, which then invokes certain feelings or ideas in the viewer, that is what any reasonable person would refer to as an artistic process and the end product is indisputably art.\n\nIf you maintain that someone using skill, intention, and taste every step of the way to bring what they envision to life isn't really art then you're probably just making a bad faith argument out of a distaste for the medium.\n\nNo different from oil painters who condemned acrylics, analog photographers who condemned digital cameras, traditional artists who condemned photoshop, instrumental musicians who condemned electronic music, etc. All of these new mediums eliminated, or \"automated\", some of the skilled labor involved in the old mediums like mixing your own pigments or playing your own instruments, while also demanding new and unique kinds of skilled labor from the artist.\n\nIf you look at the very first pieces of art produced in any brand new medium, oftentimes it is very bad and simplistic in comparison to older more developed mediums. The first electronic music was mostly just basic noise tracks until talented people showed what was possible.\n\nThe first comics and children's book illustrations to have been produced with AI which I've seen look like absolute garbage. I'll agree with that. If they even count as \"art\", they're dogshit art. They're low effort gimmicks produced without any serious skill or vision. The composition is bad, there's very little if any intention, they're only interesting insofar as they're the first attempts, but they're just objectively not very good attempts. This doesn't mean they are the limit of what is possible, not even close.\n\nEvery new medium is seen as being only a gimmick until the first really great art is released in the medium, then the great art demands our respect by showing us what is possible.\n\nAI art hasn't had that moment yet. There are no notable significant works that do something truly new and amazing. Only mediocre children's books, poorly edited comic books with laughable inconsistencies, massive amounts of weaboo anime porn, flickery 2 minute animations, and novelty pop art amalgamations of superheros with ancient Aztec aesthetics or whatever. Forgettable, gimmicky, derivative, and easy to dismiss as \"not real art\". \n\nYou can hardly blame established artists for being dismissive when there is virtually no existing AI art which does something unique, that a traditional artist couldn't have done better.\n\nIt's only a matter of time until this changes. I give it maybe another few months before somebody releases some kind of comic, animation, or videogame made with 100% AI art that receives widespread acclaim and stubborn traditionalists are forced to acknowledge it as being the product of genuine artistic skill and vision.\n\nAnd 10 or 20 years down the line, we won't be having this conversation at all. It'll just be an accepted fact that AI art can be and often is part of a genuine artistic process. Digital artists who refuse to incorporate it at all, even a little bit, will become increasingly uncommon and niche. Traditional human made digital art will become a cottage industry.","comments":["I don\\'t think that we can settle the ages old debate of what \"art\" is.","Im not sure theres ever been a reasonable good faith argument that anything can be considered not real art if the producer claims it is.","Good post. I gradually warmed up to AI-generated images supposed status as art over the last couple months upon I learning how much skill and intention *can* be involved in their creation and also trying it myself as well. ControlNet is really cool. There are still things that irk me though\\n\\n- Many AI enthusiasts not only want AI-generated images to be considered art","they want them to be seen as art *in the same way* as e.g. traditionally painting and drawing images. That is a notion that \"antis\" would be very correct to (politely but firmly) reject and I don\\'t think it\\'s okay at all to post AI-generated images in spaces where art fans gather to enjoy digital drawings and paintings specifically. Using a generative tool to apply shapes and colour to a canvas is a very different process to doing it by hand and should be judged on its own terms. It\\'s a different artistic medium.\\n\\n- I guess a frustrating thing about AI image generation is that the tool has a sort of \"mind of its own\" that you often have to fight against - it can create cool images but they might not always be what you wanted. Most of us have probably seen a meme post where someone writes gibberish into the prompt and somehow still receives a beautiful image in return. So I wouldn\\'t judge critics here too harshly because","as opposed to drawing and painting","the artistic skill and intent isn\\'t immediately obvious and verifiable.\\n\\nOf course there are people for whom the process doesn\\'t matter (and in some instances","like if your picture is just an asset for a greater end like a comic or game","it really doesn\\'t). But for many peoole it does matter. I suspect it will result in an online art culture where people track and share the creation process more openly. Digital illustrators and painters will have a natural interest in it","to set themselves apart from AI artists","and those who use AI will do it to show that their creation was indeed something that spawned from their idea and imagination - many people in the AI image generation subs share their prompts and stuff already. This is also great imo because it allows us to learn from each other better.","I think the big moment will be when an established artist makes something impressive with AI","doesn\\'t tell anyone it\\'s AI","and gets caught later on. You can already see the groundwork being laid for this drama in that Paizo announcement. Their response to \"how are you going to screen for it?\" in the comments mostly amounts to \"we\\'re gonna eyeball it\" and \"don\\'t ask don\\'t tell\". I can just see someone opening up their newest Pathfinder book and thinking","wow","this art is so cool... wait","that pinkie finger looks kinda funny...\".\\n\\nPeople are already making diamonds in the rough with inpainting and ControlNet. The issue is getting platformed so you can stand above the dime-a-dozen mass produced NovelAI and Midjourney outputs. It\\'s going to be hard to get curated when the normie hordes aren\\'t aware of what skill brings to the table with AI art","but with some sort of scandal blowing up maybe they will become aware.","Even the most strenuous antis (ie yours truly) aren\\'t disputing this point. Who are you arguing against? Piss Christ is art. A child\\'s crayon drawings are art. Art is an astoundingly low bar.\\n\\n> AI art hasn\\'t had that moment yet.

Forgettable","gimmicky","derivative","and easy to dismiss as \"not real art\".\\n\\nI sincerely hope that someday it does have its moment.

I\\'ve been waiting for someone to do some really cool shit with AI even in just like a music video","the potential for trippy shit there is huge.\\n\\nMarvel Movies and the Mona Lisa are both art","but do you want to live in a world with no paintings anymore and just more and more marvel movies?","Your fourth paragraph describes maybe a director of some sort","but it's not really equivalent to being the artist of the pictures. Training it and providing a rough composition is basically like showing a commissioned artist some styles you want them to emulate and making a sketch on a napkin to guide them","but when the artist comes back with the final product","that isn't your artwork","it's theirs.\\n\\nSimilarly someone who creates a video game might direct artists to make assets for the games","and might give approval or disapproval of them","but at the end credits there is still a distinct credit for art director and character designer or whatever else the title might be. In  this case stable diffusion would be the designer and you would be the director.","I agree with the idea that generating AI art is essentially like commissioning an artwork","but the thing about commissioning an artwork is that the more control exercised by the commissioner in what exactly the end product looks like","the more they have a compelling claim as a co-creator who deserves to be credited.\\n\\nIf two people are writing a book together and one is very creative and good at overall plot direction and character design","but not a particularly skilled writer of prose","and the other is excellent at sentence-to-sentence level writing and vocab choice but completely lacking in original ideas or ability to construct an overall narrative","don\\'t they both deserve to be credited?

You love them","critics love them","they\\'re interesting","they\\'re original","they\\'re an authentic display of human emotion.\\n\\nEven though any amatuer painter with an average amount of technical ability \"could\" have painted them","an average painter would never have thought to do so. Only someone with exceptional taste and vision could have created these paintings.\\n\\nNow","let\\'s say you found out that all of the paintings were commissioned by a disabled man who is unable to hold a brush due to his debilitating arthritis. And that this man provided the painter with extremely detailed and precise instructions about the composition of the paintings","the exact colors and lighting to be used","the thickness of the brush strokes in different areas","and sat behind the painter giving real time direction about how to proceed for each part of the painting","sometimes even having the painter start over from scratch multiple times until the results were close enough to what he envisioned.\\n\\nThe artist himself","on the other hand","contributed very little if at all to the choices made regarding the content of the paintings","only following the precise instructions of the commissioner.\\n\\nWho deserves the most credit for these paintings? Who is the real \"artist\"?\\n\\nNow imagine instead that the disabled man uses a blend of models and textual embeddings","control net masks","img-to-img with blocked in color and light values","inpainting","hundreds of iterations","etc to create a digital artwork with a precisely controlled final look.

{"id":"11k5o64","title":"Detecting AI-created art: a guide","content":"I think that there is some need for a way of telling between AI generated works and human generated art. I'll refer to the latter as 'organic' just to shorten the phrase.  There isn't a guaranteed solution that will work with every piece of AI art, but I've found (after using AI art personally and even professionally since well before Dalle-2 released to the public) that there are some good rules that can work on the vast majority of AI generated pieces to discover their non-organic origin.  \nAnd, vice-versa these can be used to tell most organic works from AI works of similar subject matter even where they likely share the similar mistakes (proportions, shading, fingers).  I'll give an example later on with the infamous real work of art banned from the art subreddit and why it should have been obvious that wasn't inorganic.  \nFor this purpose, I am going to be using a mix of images.  Some of these will be commissioned art pieces that pre-date AI art, some will be images I have generated, and some will be taken from a popular webnovel site's new releases.  \n____\nThe main three 'tells' for AI art at present are the following:\n1.  [Eyes](https://imgur.com/a/pMpeHeS) (non-circular pupils/iris, lazy eye, different colors, etc.)\n2.  [Inconsistent Hair](https://imgur.com/a/yUembDd) (loops, hair randomly starting and ending)\n3.  Composition (various issues, mostly described below)\nContextually, I also look for a few things though these absolutely aren't definitive:\n1. Anime art style (for some reason, a huge percentage of people posting AI art love anime styles)\n2. A young female as the primary subject (again, mostly off what is being made)\n3. A lack of secondary subjects\n4. Sitting or standing pose (AI is bad at dynamic posing)\n5. Head or body shot (AI is bad at other perspectives)\n6. Relatively low, square resolution (Most people generate AI at 512x512 and then might upscale as needed, which often has artifacts as seen in my hair example above)\n  \nSome anti-tells:\n1.  Non-anime artstyle \n2.  Any other perspective besides a headshot or body shot of a person standing (falling, leaning, from below, from above, from behind, etc.)\n3. Holding any weapon or tool and the hands and item making sense\n4.  Legible text incorporated into the art (e.g. writing on a sign)\n5.  Two or more subjects, particularly if they interact\n6.  High, non-square resolution without artifacts\nAnd some contextual clues that a piece is organic:\n1. Timeframe (anything published before 2022 is almost certainly not made by AI)\n2. Source - if published on Reddit or Imgur it could be anything depending on the subreddit but some places have higher moderation standards\n3. Google Reverse Image Search duplicates (human made images are more likely to have duplicates on various art sites or have very close inspirations)\n4.  Landscapes, odd resolutions, etc. are more likely to be organic\n5.  Grain and brushstrokes are more common and more sensical in human made pieces\n____\nHere is an example of tells [1 and 2](https://i.imgur.com/72PSaID.png).  The pupils are fine at a glance, but closer observation makes them murky and hard to figure out. There are also a few places where hair strands merge into a loop.  I guarantee that this is AI generated.\nHere is a bit more [ambiguous piece.](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/62087-saintess-summons-skeletons.jpg?time=1676437745)  The eyes have some signs of 'AI eye', but the rest of the piece has a lot of negatives.  In specific, the two eyes have different pupil and iris size, and the right eye is a little elliptical.  The hair better than the former piece, but there is a piece of hair 'floating' on the right.  I also think the lighting is quite good, but doesn't match the halo behind the girl.  The negatives include the skull and halo, which would be very hard to generate inorganically, as well as the hands.  Ultimately, I think the girl is only possibly AI generated (hair and eyes being clues) and the other elements (halo, skull, the girls hand) were likely added in organically.  \nHere is [another example.](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/63429-how-to-raise-a-villainess.jpg?time=1677036949)  Here, the eyes are indistinct and hair forms a loop on the right. The hands are hidden, the style is anime-adjacent, the leg is a little weird, the dog/wolf's fur is a little wooly, and the symbols on the clothing don't make much sense.  I think this is less ambiguous than the former; this is fairly likely to be AI generated.\nHere is a [counter-example](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/dragon-sorcerer--aadaynw46xi.jpg?time=1676663294) of a piece I don't think is possible to produce inorganically.  The style isn't anime, the hands are both holding things (though the left is wonky), the eyes aren't zoomed in enough to check, and the hair is logical.  But what makes me think this isn't synthesized is the separate between the foreground and background, the character interacting with stairs, and the dragon shadow on the wall.  If this used any synthesized elements, it blended them with substantial post-processing.  \nHere is [an example](https://i.redd.it/kssb9x4s5jc61.jpg) from before synthography that probably could be pretty easily done in that style today.  You see a [lot of versions](https://v.redd.it/6havjaqtkh7a1) of this on the StableDiffusion subreddit.  How could you tell that this was created organically, and [this](https://i.redd.it/q6gkaeosczca1.png) was created by StableDiffusion?  The former has consistency in its brush strokes, eyes, and hair.  The latter has non-circular eyes, a slightly muffed left hand, hair coming from the neck, buck teeth, and incomprehensible brushwork.  It also has a fair number of lumpy, non-spheroid pearls.\n____\nHere are some more examples of hard to generate perspectives:\n1.  [Falling](https://images.saatchiart.com/saatchi/872792/art/8726672/7790188-HSC00923-7.jpg)\n2.  [Swimming](https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/thumbnails/002/004/798/small/a-man-swimming-butterfly-vector.jpg)\n3.  [From below](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/84/27/62/8427627a06f19ba3ad5ed12ab8a6ca4c.jpg)\n4.  [From above](https://i.imgur.com/RFovKuM.jpg)\n5.  [Action shot](https://preview.redd.it/suf35wxjj1861.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=32257a2109ec60a42046d8058dd968de96127942)\nNow AI *can* try at some of these.  For example, here's [an action shot.](https://imgur.com/a/fG0CXzr)  The key question is: do all parts of this image make sense?  Where is the left foot?  What is going on with the pinky?  What symbols are supposed to be shown on the fabric?\nHere's [another example](https://imgur.com/c062d725-ca8c-414a-9436-c51f1d7c35dc) that I think is a lot more difficult.  You can't clearly see the eyes, the hands are hidden, and the piece is just busy enough to excuse most of what you see.  I think the only tell from the 'does every individual part make sense' test is the random stripe of motion from the left shoulder.  Sometimes these can be [extremely subtle](https://imgur.com/a/SY95kEh); I'd argue the only tells in this piece are the slightly bulky right hand and hair randomly under the left arm that doesn't make sense.\n____\nNow, let's look at [this piece.](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/01/benmoran-art-olivier-final-as-683x1024.jpg) This was infamously banned from the art subreddit for being 'AI art'.  How does it fair on our tests?\nFirst, if we zoom in on the [eyes \n](https://imgur.com/a/CFt47O7), we see two circular irises with reasonably similar pupils, pointed in the same direction.  This is a big sign that the piece is organic.  We also see that the [hands](https://imgur.com/a/Nr7Nf1x) are sensible, with the right hand even grabbing a piece of cloth.  The [hair](https://imgur.com/a/SHFCt0Y) on the right probably should be swept to the left, but overall the hair is relatively consistent and doesn't loop.\nThe biggest tell that the piece is organic, however, is the composition.  In addition to the girl, you have four birds, two floating eyes, and a castle in the background as subjects.  This type of multi-subject piece would be difficult to do synthographically.  In-painting could theoretically paint in some of the subjects, but the consistency of the clouds covering the eyes would be hard to do as well as getting the eyes similar in general.  The birds are also reasonably put together.  \n____\nAnd here are some more pieces analyzed from random new releases on webnovel sites:\n* [Piece 1](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/to-seize-the-skies-aaaau7nhabm.jpg?time=1678049837) - This is almost certainly organic.  Male and non-anime are clues, but the shot from the back is a big giveaway.  It also passes the piecewise composition test.\n* [Piece 2](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/necromancers-ascension-aaaark3lxi.jpg?time=1678010510) - The somewhat random geometry on this one lends me to think it is non-organic in origin.  Taking a look a random sections, a lot don't really make sense out of context.\n* [Piece 3](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/questions-for-another-time-aada4jxzabm.jpg?time=1678047717) - You could do this synthographically, but I don't know why you'd need to\n* [Piece 4](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/65271-the-screaming-plague-of-ash.jpg?time=1678069251) - Landscape, and seems to make sense individually.  I'd be very surprised if this isn't organic.\n* [Piece 5](https://www.royalroadcdn.com/public/covers-large/marvel-the-gamer-sorcerer-aabaarqoabm.jpg?time=1678034732) - I'm not sure what is going on with this one; it makes just lack of sense I'm tempted to say this is AI.\n* [Piece 6](https://imgur.com/a/jA7huRU) - This is also a back shot, but there are enough clues to conclude this is AI generated.  The big clue is the awkward, nonsensically shaped 'axe' and the lack of a hand holding it.  AI hates swords, axes, and shovels.  The lack of eyes and hedgehog hair are also clues, as well as the anime style and weird backpack.

Also clearly, UMG plans to make money off AI. I sincerely apologize for my biases showing in my snide commentary.\n\n>Learning from millions of images with associated descriptions of subject matter, composition, methodology and other inputs, the most advanced AI can now generate derivative output that closely mimics original creators’ distinct styles. In some cases, this is used to produce outright fakes. Often, it simply produces a flood of imitations — diluting the market, making original creations harder to find and violating artists’ legal rights to compensation from their work.\n\nBeing a music exec, he inevitably and predictably makes the Napster comparison. In that instance he says, \"copyright saved the day.\"\n\n>It’s quite understandable, then, that these developments have led to profound concerns in our industry, with similarities being drawn between AI’s rise and the rise of Napster and unlicensed music sharing over twenty years ago. **At that time, it was copyright law that saved the day, ensuring that artists and labels were protected.**\n\nI can see that copyright was used to shore up music industry conglomerates with the advent of streaming. Note that UMG owns part of Spotify which notoriously pays artists less than pennies per stream. (Music Business Worldwide: Universal’s stake in Spotify is worth over $1.6bn… but it’s got no plans to sell up [https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universals-stake-in-spotify-is-worth-over-1-6bn-but-its-got-no-plans-to-sell-up/](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universals-stake-in-spotify-is-worth-over-1-6bn-but-its-got-no-plans-to-sell-up/) Forbes: Spotify Says It Paid $7 Billion In Royalties In 2021 Amid Claims Of Low Pay From Artists [https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/?sh=5cbfddeaa0db](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/?sh=5cbfddeaa0db)) \n\nAlso note UMG is currently being sued for screwing over recording artist via sweetheart deals with Spotify. (Reuters: Lawsuit claims UMG cut artists' royalties under secret Spotify deal [https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/lawsuit-claims-umg-cut-artists-royalties-under-secret-spotify-deal-2023-01-04/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/lawsuit-claims-umg-cut-artists-royalties-under-secret-spotify-deal-2023-01-04/))\n\nUMG isn't rejecting AI, though. If fact they are already using it, (and investing in it).\n\n>Here at Universal Music, we’re embracing such innovative uses of AI. In fact, we already hold three AI patents focused not on creation of music, but instead on transforming the way artists reach new fans and sustain listeners in today’s engagement economy.\n\nWhat he doesn't tell you is that UMG has invested in Soundful, a generative AI music platform. (Digital Music News: AI Music-Creation Platform Soundful Raises $3.8 Million from Universal Music Group, Beatport, Disney, and Others [https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/04/22/soundful-seed-round/](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/04/22/soundful-seed-round/))\n\n>In all of AI’s various utilizations, promoting artists’ interests is paramount. Central to that overriding philosophy is our belief that unless creators are respected and fairly compensated when their works are exploited to train AI, the world’s creators will suffer widespread and lasting harm.\n\nYes, UMG is known for supporting artists. (The Verge: Universal’s new contracts will make it more difficult for artists to rerecord their work [https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783954/universal-contracts-music-taylor-swift-taylors-version](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783954/universal-contracts-music-taylor-swift-taylors-version))\n\n>To help catalyze and accelerate protection of the creative class in this emerging era of AI, Universal Music Group — working together with leading counterparts across the arts and creative industries, as well as legal scholars, public officials and representatives of the AI industry itself — will explore ways to ensure that generative AI properly rewards the people whose intellectual property constitutes the critical contributing material fueling AI’s output, and not solely AI’s financial interests.\n\nI read this as \"UMG plans to make money on this\"\n\n>In this context policymakers should approach the development of any public policy proposals covering AI thoughtfully and carefully so that these initiatives buttress copyright and promote innovation, supporting tech entrepreneurs without doing harm to artists and their rights.\n\nYou, as a creator, should know that you're in good hands when you \"collaborate\" with the music industry.\n\n>We hope the entire creative community, and those who share our vision of collaborative opportunity in the AI technology field, will join us in this effort to ensure that creators everywhere reap the rewards of their work, and that the power of AI’s new and extraordinary capabilities are properly harnessed for the common good.\n\nI'm done being sarcastic. Please read the whole op-ed as my commentary likely skews and skewers the opinion unfairly.","comments":["That was a fun read","though I admit it was more like hate-reading","because anyone who thinks that copyright and the music industry \"solved\" Napster is...well","a music industry exec.

{"id":"11lhxbi","title":"Looking for help and sources for my AI research project","content":"Hello fellow Ai enthusiasts,\n\nI am reserching Ai history, development and society consequences with a focus on models and how they are working. On a visual not mathematical level. My goal is to make a film about the topic and write a paper for my university. I am studying art and animation and currently I am searching for sources. The primary audience wont be IT people but artists. My focus is primarily on image and video generating AI especially with open models and stable diffusion\n\nWhat am I looking for:\n-sources on AI history, preferably books, scientific, but not on a level were an IT degree is necessary to understand it\n-sources on how Ai is working, text to image as well as image to image /control net etc. (preferably books, scientific, but not on a level were a it studiy is necessary to understand)\n-sources and breakdowns of training and how it's working \n-cultural impact of AI and how it changed the art world so far \n-video sourses like YT would be nice too, or essays etc. but mostly stuff I can quote\n- If someone realy experienced reads this and likes to help, feel free to send me a pm!\n- I would love to do maybe one or two interviews for more input but this will need time since I just startet to work on this topic.\n-I am always open for ideas and collaborations! \n\nWhat I am not looking for:\n-doomposts like \"The AI is so evil\"-stuff. I am fine to counter arguments to AI, but only if well written and argumented.\n-the law side of things. I don’t study law and like to keep it this way. Also I believe there will be so many changes in the next time that it would be impracticable to include it\nThe goal of the work:\nI want to communicate visualy how AI works and where the image generation came from (history).  I know AI and it's features are developing fast and we are surely not at the peak this technology can do. But I want to give a glimpse into the mechanics and workings of Ai. another goal is, not necessarily defending AI art, but let my fellow artists understand it. I don’t want my peers to fear the technology. I don’t trink it will take our jobs but I believe it’s a powerful tool witch can make the laborious task of animation way easier and can assist und small artists and students in doing great stuff. I believe much of the hate against AI comes from fear and not understanding the topic.\n\nThe timeframe: In the best case I want to finish the paper and film untill the end of July/early August, in the worst case it will take till December/January (possible university deadlines) \n\nAbout me: I am an animation mayor at university, I have no background in IT but I am following AI and its development since I guess 2018 and just think it's realy interesting but I already made 3 short films with AI assistance and I am planning another one for this year. My backround is in traditional handrawn 2D animation and after effects motion graphics\nThanks - Rosendorne","comments":["Have you thought of using ChatGPT to help with your development process?

{"id":"11m1ers","title":"Do you view AI as 'Zero Sum'?","content":"I believe that the main source of outrage from human artists is the perceived zero sum nature of AI. The perception of a zero sum relationship is at the root of all conflict throughout human history.\n\n>**Zero-sum game** is a [mathematical representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) and [economic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_theory) of a situation which involves two sides, where the result is an advantage for one side and an equivalent loss for the other.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game#cite_note-1) In other words, player one's gain is equivalent to player two's loss, therefore the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game#cite_note-2)\n\nArtists view AI as zero sum for two reasons:\n\n1. **Economic:** This is self evident. AI presents a threat to their ability to make a career out of their art.\n2. **Status:** AI, because of its ability to spit out high quality visual compositions quickly from simple prompts, the perception is that AI devalues their own value as an artist. AI can often deliver work that is even outside of their own capabilities, which is mentally distressing if one focuses on that comparison.\n\nThe way the models were trained is often cited as the main reason for their complaints (and I share some of their concerns), but even if they were 100% ethically trained, I still believe there would still be a backlash because of the zero sum perception among artists.\n\nA zero sum view can lead people into some unfortunate and potentially dangerously misguided directions:\n\n[https://effectiviology.com/zero-sum-bias/#:\\~:text=searching%20for%20information.-,Dangers%20of%20the%20zero%2Dsum%20bias,that%20mutual%20gain%20is%20impossible](https://effectiviology.com/zero-sum-bias/#:~:text=searching%20for%20information.-,Dangers%20of%20the%20zero%2Dsum%20bias,that%20mutual%20gain%20is%20impossible).\n\n>The zero-sum bias can lead to various issues, including:  \n>  \n>Increased [interpersonal conflicts](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay3761) and decreased cooperation, especially when this bias promotes belief in an [antagonistic nature](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022115572226) of social relationships, and makes people mistakenly believe that [mutual gain](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41296-019-00375-3) is impossible. Furthermore, the bias can sometimes lead to escalation, for example one party displays a zero-sum bias, which causes the other party to react in a negative way and display the bias too, out of retaliation and because they assume that the first party knows something that they don’t.  \n>  \n>Increased immoral behavior, for example this bias drives people to [justify](https://web.archive.org/web/20220806160402/https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/10034) acting in a selfish or discriminatory way.  \n>  \n>Worse ability to [assess information](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618818484) and make decisions in many everyday situations, for example when choosing [what products to buy](https://doi.org/10.1086/677841) or what career path to follow.  \n>  \n>These issues play a role on both individual and group scales. For example, the zero-sum bias could cause an individual to achieve worse outcomes due to their misguided unwillingness to cooperate with others, or it could do the same for [government institutions](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41296-019-00375-3).\n\nSo do you view AI as a zero sum threat? If so, what can and should be done to to make human/AI relations more non-zero sum?","comments":["It's not a zero sum even","it's worse. In some fields","the flood of generated works may flush and bury both artists and ai-artists equally. Everyone who want to stay visible would have to adapt","ai or not. Ai-artists","who only started","will likely drop out as competent artists increase their effort in narrative or complicated aesthetics","or something highly captivating that is beyond the scope of our tools. As ai-artist","I don't like this situation eigher. It was a hard landing","straight into increased concurrence and of course anger.","I guess the strategy is to maybe start assuming that if getting something aesthetic is cheap. Then how can you make art that expands on that? \\n\\nMaybe having say","an \"album\" of images that work together to tell a story","narrative","message","etc. Like in music.\\n\\nPerhaps you can use it to create more multi-media work that would be too time intensive or skill intensive otherwise (making textures with ai for 3d rendering comes to mind)\\n\\nThe concept here is to basically give AI its own niche or to leverage its unique qualities for its benefit. Helps to give traditional painting more space.\\n\\nAn alternative concept could be to make people more hungry for visual art. Maybe by emphasizing more about ideas and experience over aesthetics. Make art more valuable beyond being eye candy before swiping to the next thing. Either that or leaning to the opposite and just being so eye-poppingly stunning and formally well-structured. \\n\\nThe overall direction I\\'m thinking about is how to expand peoples interest and consumption of art to avoid zero-sum problems. We like art as humans","I don\\'t think there\\'s a reason why we can\\'t look at more art. \\n\\nAnother concept we can use is to make people slow down when looking at art (a strategy to make people look at \"less\" art as a creative provocation). Find a way to get people to look at art for longer and get more of a squeeze out of it. Maybe by slowing people down. People can get a stronger appreciation for all the little details that traditional artists add that AI struggles with. Maybe teach people about other elements of art that take more time to deal with","things like art context","symbolism","meaning","interpretation","etc. \\n\\nMaybe emphasize in-person art viewings and make people fill out simple questionnaires with helpful insightful statements to help people get that \\'ah-ha\\' moment. Get people to be a little creative with the art and build onto the art until they have some personal epiphany. \\n\\nHonestly","its an interesting problem. Realistically. I just imagine that it will just go the way with photography. The art world changes what it means to make \"good art","most likely by leaning away from aesthetics and more toward formalism","expressionism","etc.","I saw your comment on another post speaking briefly on this and I found your explanation really compelling. I agree","this seems like a core issue with the anti-ai perspective.","I wouldn't frame it as a relationship/game between humans and AI. Instead","I would frame it as a game between the artistic community and AI companies. Have those companies been collaborating","or defecting (to use the Prisoner's Dilemma analogy?)","I can't argue about economics because this isn't a topic im comfortable with but about status\\n>Status: AI","because of its ability to spit out high quality visual compositions quickly from simple prompts","the perception is that AI devalues their own value as an artist. AI can often deliver work that is even outside of their own capabilities","which is mentally distressing if one focuses on that comparison. \\n\\n> even if they were 100% ethically trained","I still believe there would still be a backlash because of the zero sum perception among artists.\\n\\nI actually half-agreed with that. From my pov","AI isn't devalued art","rather","AI led people to MISUNDERSTOOD the value of art and that's why so many artists are angry\\n\\nLet's say you had a vision in your head","you want to made it a reality","you can write 10 prompt worth of paragraphs in the most details ways possible but you still at the mercy of the machine to put out something even remotely close to what you've imagined. It's understandable people who spend time honing their skill to create what they've imagined into reality feel insulted. \\n\\nIn many ways","Art isn't just about the final product","it's much closer to a performance like playing music more than people like to think.","Actually interesting post. I might write a more elaborate response later","Unlike the other antis","who would still be protesting when good results/common ground happens. I see good potential in the near future.

I\\'ve copied the relevant portion from section (III) here:\\n\\n>In other cases","however","a work containing AI-generated material will also contain sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim. For example","a human may select or arrange AI-generated material in a sufficiently creative way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.^(33) Or an artist may modify material originally generated by AI technology to such a degree that the modifications meet the standard for copyright protection.^(34) In these cases","copyright will only protect the human-authored aspects of the work","which are independent of and do not affect the copyright status of the AI-generated material itself.^(35)  \\n>  \\n>This policy does not mean that technological tools cannot be part of the creative process. Authors have long used such tools to create their works or to recast","transform","or adapt their expressive authorship. For example","a visual artist who uses Adobe Photoshop to edit an image remains the author of the modified image","^(36) and a musical artist may use effects such as guitar pedals when creating a sound recording. In each case","what matters is the extent to which the human had creative control over the works expression and actually formed the traditional elements of authorship.^(37)\\n\\nThis suggests that the \"best\" approach for receiving copyright is generally going to be starting with one or more human-made sketches and using something like ControlNet to transmute them into semi-finished works","ensuring that the human artist\\'s copyright includes *at minimum* the larger-scale composition and features of the work. Similarly","workflows that make use of inpainting are almost certainly \"selecting\" from multiple AI outputs for the affected portions of the image.\\n\\nFor example","in one older work of mine","I sketched a sci-fi \"shuttle\" of sorts over a generated background","inpainted a few times to \"enhance\" the shuttle until I got a nice nosecone for the front","then inpainted over some manual Photoshop overpainting to get nicer engines in the back. Finally","I re-composited the final version of the shuttle with the original background to remove some incidental mutation of the background immediately around the shuttle.

For example","in the same example as earlier","I started with a 1920832 image to get my basic background generation (starting with a different aspect ratio gave me better control over the composition pre-ControlNet)","then \"outpainted\" it upwards to 19201080 with sky and scattered clouds through some *very crude* (lightly-shaded blobs in a handful of unique colours) painting in Photoshop that I then enhanced with inpainting. I\\'m not *sure* that I\\'d deserve copyright on those clouds","even though I did put some manual work into them","because I see the result as significantly transformative from my input.","That's actually extremely clear terms.

Well, it's  possible that generative AI will allow you to take your script and then  actually create movie based on your ideas. You could become an indie  filmmaker.  \n>  \n>Basically just imagine  yourself as the art director, the master of the studio, the composer,  and that any skill you don't have that would be needed to produce  larger, complex creative projects you have a vision for, you can tap  into various generative AI to help you produce it.\nThinking more about this: What are the implications?\n1.

{"id":"11usojs","title":"How to create thousands really artful pictures with autonomous AI-based system, which generates paintings that are not ashamed to place over the fireplace","content":"**1. Greeting**\nHello everyone! I'm backend-developer, and in January I started my pet-project - **fully autonomous AI-based system for infinite pictures production**. I called it **Artchitect**. Image creation is fully automatic and continious, and each artwork being created exactly in 60 seconds.\n[Card #9325 \\(one of the ffirst cards\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fq31ug8prioa1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c8472bd14bb61d81ba9009849e8ed5755258d5e)\nArtchitect created 100k+ artworks in 2 months, and it's time to answer the question from movie \"I, Robot\"(2004): \"Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?\"...\n**2. Technical**\nArtchitect is fully autonomous, human can't interact with the system and change decisions of Artchitect. Artchitect in it's work completely relies on the true-random-number generator, which used for every decision. I made this true-random-number generator based on webcam.\nWhen Artchitect need make any decision - webcam take one shot, it's being converted into number, and then this number used to select some initial conditions for picture (prompt + seed). Artchitect based on dictionaries with tags, and it randomly selects some amount of tags for each picture. We can say, that Artchitect based only on random.\nExample of prompt, seed and resulting picture:\n**seed**=1690838832\n**prompt(tags)**=\"house,acrylic palette knife,starfleet,avengers,plus,mountain,coal,trash,sci-fi,physics,god of war,by makoto shinkai,diablo,realistic,biological\"\n[Card #109464](https://preview.redd.it/o2cwsq3srioa1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812cde9314001e46a6d2d6ae9a0f05df997703e6)\nImage looks pretty, but tags are garbage. Diablo? God of War? But we don't see this tags on picture, because AI wisely ignores extra tags, if it don't want to use them all. Artchitect using Stable Diffusion v1.5 - it's open, and it also beautifully paints pictures that are pleasant to the human eye.\n**3. Quality**\nAll the images are splitted into hundreds, and in each hundred you can find a dozen beautiful artworks worthy of being on the wall above your fireplace. It's not just collages from tags - most of artworks are logical, beautiful and pleasant.\nAlso I tried to make pictures printable, so I can print them on 40x60 canvas, and quality is good.\n[3 artworks printed on canvases](https://preview.redd.it/9hw6zwgxsioa1.jpg?width=1991&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82bd700239cc63af5017df2f3db4ab6c5553f39c)\n**4. Diversity**\nSuch system architecture gives good results - paintings never the same, and most part of artworks is really unique, because it contains some unique story. Although there are also similar works, because some tags are very \"powerful\". There are also enough broken artworks, but they sometimes have interesting ideas and their own uniqueness - their own style. From SD v1.5 we got broken fingers, limbs and double heads, and this already is the part of the artistic-DNA of the Architect.\nAt the moment, more than 111k artworks have already been drawn. To see the diversity, I came up with the idea of combining groups of paintings into [Unities](https://artchitect.space/unity) (collages).\n[Example of diversity in unities - two \\\\\"10k-unities\\\\\" U09XXXX and U08XXXX. Each 10k-unity have 10k pictures inside.](https://preview.redd.it/f8uv2lx8tioa1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a0a89b45ee52f1ad1ceac1e42602cdd5044789b)\n**5. Results**\nI've been looking at the Artchitect for 2 months, and it still surprises me every day. It's potential in fantasy and variety is limitless, as Stable Diffusion contains an infinite number of options. Yes, some pictures are already boring, but this does not prevent from creating a couple of hundred unique  paintings every day.new\nOr in other words, in 2023 we already have a real AI, capable of logically creating and logically inventing something new, and not just randomly assembling from pieces.\nSo, Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece? I think, yes!\nArtchitect's website with all artworks - [https://artchitect.space](https://artchitect.space)\nThanks for reading!","comments":["Ignores the decisions of humans\\nWell.
